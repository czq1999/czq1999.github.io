He served as President of the Government of Catalonia from 17 May 2018 to 28 September 2020 , when the Supreme Court of Spain confirmed a court ruling by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia condemning him because of disobeying the Central Electoral Board during the April 2019 general election , leading to his disqualification from office . Born in Blanes , Torra graduated from the Autonomous University of Barcelona before joining the legal profession . He worked as executive for a multinational insurance company for twenty years before starting his own publishing company . He later held senior positions for the City of Barcelona and Generalitat de Catalunya . A supporter of Catalan independence , and former member of Democratic Union of Catalonia and Reagrupament , Torra does not currently belong to any political party . He has held senior positions in several pro-independence organisations including the Òmnium Cultural and Assemblea Nacional Catalana . He was elected to the Parliament of Catalonia at the 2017 regional election as an independent candidate for the pro-independence Together for Catalonia electoral alliance . In May 2018 he was elected 131st president of the Government of Catalonia after the Spanish courts blocked three other candidates . Early life and family . Torra was born on 28 December 1962 in Blanes , a town in the Province of Girona in north-eastern Catalonia ( Spain ) . He is the third of four children ( three boys and one girl ) . His family were originally from Santa Coloma de Farners but moved to Blanes where his father , also known as Quim Torra , worked as an engineer at the Sociedad Anónima de Fibras Artificiales ( SAFA ) plant . The family then moved to Barcelona where Torras father worked as a manager for SAFA . Torra was educated at St . Ignatius College , Barcelona , better known as Jesuïtes Sarrià . Torra joined the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 1980 , graduating in 1985 with a degree in law . His parents later returned to Santa Coloma de Farners where his father was a municipal councillor in 1991 and where his widowed mother still lives . Professional career . Torra worked as an executive for Winterthur Group , a multinational insurance company , for nearly twenty years including two years at the companys offices in the Canton of Zürich in Switzerland . Whilst in Switzerland he started researching Eugeni Xammar , a Catalan journalist who worked for the United Nations , igniting a passion for Catalan journalism during the 1920s and 1930s . When AXA took over Winterthur Torra was offered a position in Madrid but he chose to return to Catalonia to devote himself to journalism and publishing . In 2008 Torra founded A Contra Vent Editors , a publisher specialising in literary and humorous journalism , focusing on the revival of Catalonias literary and journalistic tradition during the 1920s and 1930s . Torra has written several books on the history of Catalonia , journalism and biographies and in 2009 he won the Carles Rahola award for Viatge Involuntari a la Catalunya Impossible , an essay on the history of Catalan journalism that mixes fact and fiction to narrate the life of several Catalan journalists during the Second Spanish Republic , including Just Cabot , Lluís Capdevila , Àngel Ferran , Manuel Fontdevila and Francisco Madrid . He has also written articles for the Ara , El Punt Avui , El Temps and Nació Digital . From September 2011 to 2015 , during the mayorship of Xavier Trias , Torra was in charge of promoting the district of Ciutat Vella as director of Foment de Ciutat Vella , SA . In June 2012 he became director of the Born Centre de Cultura i Memòria but in September 2015 , shortly after Ada Colau became mayor , he left the organisation . He was appointed director of Revista de Catalunya in May 2015 . He was director of the Generalitats Center for Contemporary Subject Studies from March 2016 to October 2017 . He is currently working as a lawyer and is a member of the Bar Association of Barcelona . Activism and politics . Torra is a member of the pro-Catalan independence Òmnium Cultural ( OC ) , of which he was vice-president from 2013 to 2015 , and Assemblea Nacional Catalana ( ANC ) . He was president of the pro-independence Sobirania i Justícia from 2010 to 2011 and a member of the permanent council of the ANC in 2012 . In 2011 Torra and lawyer Jordi Cortada filed a lawsuit before the European Court of Human Rights against the Constitutional Courts re-writing of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia . When the OC president , Muriel Casals i Couturier , was chosen as a candidate for the 2015 Catalan regional election Torra was appointed as president in July 2015 , serving until December 2015 when he was replaced by Jordi Cuixart . Torra was associated with the Democratic Union of Catalonia ( UDC ) , a regionalist center-right party , and later Reagrupament , a splinter group of the left-wing pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia ( ERC ) . Torra is not a member of any political party and is known to have reservations about certain policies of the Catalan European Democratic Party ( PDeCAT ) , the main constituent of the pro-independence Together for Catalonia ( JuntsxCat ) electoral alliance . He is believed to be on good terms with the left-wing pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy ( CUP ) which is not a member of JuntsxCat . Torra contested the 2017 regional election as an independent JuntsxCat candidate in the Province of Barcelona and was elected to the Parliament of Catalonia . At the election Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament . Attempts by the secessionists to inaugurate three candidates – Carles Puigdemont , Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Turull – as President of Catalonia were thwarted by the Spanish courts . In May 2018 Torra , the so-called plan D , was nominated as candidate for president . At the investiture vote held on 12 May 2018 Torra secured 66 votes ( JuntsxCat 34 ; ERC–CatSí 32 ) with 65 votes against ( Cs 36 ; PSC 17 ; CatComú–Podem 8 ; PP 4 ) and four abstentions ( CUP-CC 4 ) , failing to achieve the 68 votes necessary for an absolute majority . As a result , a second vote was held on 14 May 2018 at which he only needed a simple majority to become president . The result of the second vote was exactly the same as the first vote – 66 in favour , 65 against and four abstentions – and as a result Torra was elected the 131st President of Catalonia . He was sworn in on 17 May 2018 . On May 19 he appointed his government , which included as regional ministers , Jordi Turull and Josep Rull ( in preventive custody ) as well as Toni Comín and Lluís Puig , in self-imposed exile in Belgium and also required by the Spanish justice . Since article 155 was still in force , Mariano Rajoy decided not to publish the appointments in the Generalitat government gazette , which led to a criminal complaint for prevarication brought by President Torra . In order to avoid extending the application of article 155 , on May 29 President Torra appointed a new government , which took office on June 2 , which ended a period of seven months of direct rule on Catalonia from Madrid . In December 2018 , Torra announced a 48-hour fast in solidarity with the prisoners of Lledoners who were carrying out a hunger strike , Jordi Sànchez , Jordi Turull , Joaquim Forn and Josep Rull . Controversial writings . The tone and content of some articles written by Torra in 2012 criticizing anti-Catalanism and Spain have elicited strong criticism from numerous sectors . Critics have accused Torra of being xenophobic and a supremacist . In an online editorial , he metaphorically described people who live in Catalonia but reject Catalan-nationalism and culture as beasts or scavengers , vipers , hyenas , who have a little bump in their DNA chain . In addition , several tweets from 2012 that he later removed included sentences like Spaniards only know how to plunder and Spaniards in Catalonia are like energy – they transform themselves but do not disappear . At European level , the President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group , Hans van Baalen condemned his rhetoric as separatist and racist and the Party of European Socialists stated that his racist remarks are utterly disgusting and cast deep doubts about his fitness for the job . The Catalan chapter of French NGO SOS Racisme also criticized the tone of the articles , but stated they cannot be considered racism . Torra apologised for the tweets after being nominated to be president . Judicial case and disqualification . On 19 December 2019 Torra was sentenced by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia ( TSJC ) to a year and a half of disqualification ( inhabilitación ) from holding any elected office and/or from exercising government powers , in addition to a fine of €30,000 for disobeying the Central Electoral Board ( JEC ) by not withdrawing partisan symbols in the Palau de la Generalitat and not guaranteeing the institutions neutrality during the April election campaign . Torra then vowed to appeal the sentence ( not firm ) to a higher instance , the Supreme Court ( TS ) . On 3 January 2020 the JEC determined the execution of the TSJC sentence in regards of Torras electability as member of the Parliament of Catalonia , ruling Torras inhabilitation from his parliamentary seat . The JEC left open to interpretation if losing the seat would also entail the disqualification from the post of president of the regional government . Torra appealed again to the TS to clarify the JEC ruling , on whether the electoral authority actually had the authority to strip him of the parliamentary seat . The second appeal before the TS by Torra was turned down . Enforcing the ruling of the JEC , the Secretary of the Parliament of Catalonia stripped Torra of his status as legislator on 27 January 2020 . Torra compelled then the Houses Speaker , ERCs Roger Torrent ( who had announced he would not take the vote of Torra into consideration ) to contempt unless he wanted to put the institutions at risk , to no success . The Parliament of Catalonia had interpreted the Statute of Catalonia in the sense that the President of the Generalitat could remain in the post , as the status of legislator would be necessary only at the moment of the investiture , so , for the time being and pending the resolution of his appeal before the TS , Torra remains as president of the Catalan Government . Symptoms of collapse of the JuntsxCat–ERC coalition government ensued after Torras unseating , with the absence in the votings of the full JuntsxCat bloc vis-à-vis the passing of the Parliaments budget and a defiant Torra , who refrained then from calling a new election , nonetheless . A day after Torra argued that the ( legislative ) term had no political future if unity cannot be maintained and announced his intention to call a new election , but not until the regional budget was passed . Personal life . Torra is married to teacher Carola Miró . They have three children , two girls and a boy . On 16 March 2020 , he announced in a public appearance he was positive for COVID-19 during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain .

A supporter of Catalan independence , and former member of Democratic Union of Catalonia and Reagrupament , Torra does not currently belong to any political party . He has held senior positions in several pro-independence organisations including the Òmnium Cultural and Assemblea Nacional Catalana . He was elected to the Parliament of Catalonia at the 2017 regional election as an independent candidate for the pro-independence Together for Catalonia electoral alliance . In May 2018 he was elected 131st president of the Government of Catalonia after the Spanish courts blocked three other candidates . Torra contested the 2017 regional election as an independent JuntsxCat candidate in the Province of Barcelona and was elected to the Parliament of Catalonia . At the election Catalan secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan Parliament . Attempts by the secessionists to inaugurate three candidates – Carles Puigdemont , Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Turull – as President of Catalonia were thwarted by the Spanish courts . In May 2018 Torra , the so-called plan D , was nominated as candidate for president . At the investiture vote held on 12 May 2018 Torra secured 66 votes ( JuntsxCat 34 ; ERC–CatSí 32 ) with 65 votes against ( Cs 36 ; PSC 17 ; CatComú–Podem 8 ; PP 4 ) and four abstentions ( CUP-CC 4 ) , failing to achieve the 68 votes necessary for an absolute majority . As a result , a second vote was held on 14 May 2018 at which he only needed a simple majority to become president . The result of the second vote was exactly the same as the first vote – 66 in favour , 65 against and four abstentions – and as a result Torra was elected the 131st President of Catalonia . He was sworn in on 17 May 2018 . On May 19 he appointed his government , which included as regional ministers , Jordi Turull and Josep Rull ( in preventive custody ) as well as Toni Comín and Lluís Puig , in self-imposed exile in Belgium and also required by the Spanish justice . Since article 155 was still in force , Mariano Rajoy decided not to publish the appointments in the Generalitat government gazette , which led to a criminal complaint for prevarication brought by President Torra . In order to avoid extending the application of article 155 , on May 29 President Torra appointed a new government , which took office on June 2 , which ended a period of seven months of direct rule on Catalonia from Madrid . In December 2018 , Torra announced a 48-hour fast in solidarity with the prisoners of Lledoners who were carrying out a hunger strike , Jordi Sànchez , Jordi Turull , Joaquim Forn and Josep Rull . On 19 December 2019 Torra was sentenced by the High Court of Justice of Catalonia ( TSJC ) to a year and a half of disqualification ( inhabilitación ) from holding any elected office and/or from exercising government powers , in addition to a fine of €30,000 for disobeying the Central Electoral Board ( JEC ) by not withdrawing partisan symbols in the Palau de la Generalitat and not guaranteeing the institutions neutrality during the April election campaign . Torra then vowed to appeal the sentence ( not firm ) to a higher instance , the Supreme Court ( TS ) .</p><p>pred_time: President of the Government of Catalonia</p><p>groundtruth: President of Catalonia</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-4"/wiki/Ashley_Vincent#P54#0</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Ashley_Vincent#P54#0<p>context: Ashley Vincent Ashley Derek Vincent ( born 26 May 1985 ) is an English former football player and manager .

( football ) Galatasaray Spor Kulübü ( , Galatasaray Sports Club ) is a professional football club based on the European side of the city of Istanbul in Turkey . It is the association football branch of the larger Galatasaray Sports Club of the same name , itself a part of the Galatasaray Community Cooperation Committee which includes Galatasaray High School where the football club was founded in October 1905 consisting entirely of student members . The team traditionally play in dark shades of red and yellow at home , with the shirts split down the middle between the two colours . Galatasaray have won 22 Süper Lig titles , 18 Turkish Cups and 16 Turkish Super Cups . Galatasaray is one of three teams to have participated in all seasons of the Süper Lig since 1959 , following the dissolution of the Istanbul Football League . Internationally , Galatasaray has won the UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2000 , becoming the first and only Turkish team to win a major UEFA competition . In the 1999–2000 season , the club achieved the rare feat of completing a quadruple by winning the Süper Lig , the Turkish Cup , the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in a single season . Galatasaray is also the only Turkish club to have been ranked first on the IFFHS World Rankings . Since 2011 , the clubs stadium is the 52,332-capacity Türk Telekom Stadium in Seyrantepe , Istanbul . Previously , the club played at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium , as well as a succession of other grounds in Istanbul , which included groundshares with Beşiktaş and Fenerbahçe at the Taksim Stadium and İnönü Stadium . The club has a long-standing rivalry with other major Istanbul teams , namely with Beşiktaş and Fenerbahçe . The derby between Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe is dubbed the Kıtalar Arası Derbi ( ) due to the location of their headquarters and stadiums on the European ( Galatasaray ) and Asian ( Fenerbahçe ) sides of the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul . As a result of the teams 20th championship for the 2014–15 Süper Lig season , their logo hereafter contains four stars representing their 20 championships for the league ; each star corresponds to five of the teams championships . Galatasaray is the first and only four-star sports club in Turkish Football League . History . Galatasaray SK was founded in October 1905 ( the exact day is disputed , but is traditionally accepted as 17 Teşrinievvel 1321 according to the Rumi calendar , which corresponds to 30 October 1905 according to the Gregorian calendar ) by albanian Ali Sami Yen and other students of Galatasaray High School ( a high school in Istanbul which was established in 1481 ) as a football club . Ali Sami Yen became Galatasaray SKs first president and was given the clubs membership number 1 . The teams first match was against Cadi-Keuy FC and Galatasaray won this match with a score of 2–0 . There were discussions about the clubs name , in which some suggested Gloria ( victory ) and others Audace ( courage ) , but it was decided that its name would be Galatasaray . In addition to Ali Sami Yen ( Club member No . 1 ) , who was the driving force behind the clubs foundation , Asim Tevfik Sonumut ( 2 ) , Emin Bülent Serdaroğlu ( 3 ) , Celal İbrahim ( 4 ) , Boris Nikolov ( 5 ) , Milo Bakić ( 6 ) , Pavle Bakić ( 7 ) , Bekir Sıtkı Bircan ( 8 ) , Tahsin Nihat ( 9 ) , Reşat Şirvanizade ( 10 ) , Hüseyin Hüsnü ( 11 ) , Refik Cevdet Kalpakçıoğlu ( 12 ) and Abidin Daver ( 13 ) were also involved in the decision to organize such a club . The name Galatasaray itself comes from that of Galatasaray High School , which in turn takes its name from Galata Sarayı Enderûn-u Hümâyûn ( Galata Palace Imperial School ) , the name of the original school founded on the site in 1481 , and which in turn took its name from the nearby medieval Genoese citadel of Galata ( the modern quarter of Karaköy ) in the Beyoğlu ( Pera ) district of Istanbul . Galatasaray literally means Galata palace . According to researcher Cem Atabeyoğlu , Galatasaray took its name from one of its first matches . In that match , Galatasaray won 2–0 over a local Greek club , and the spectators called them Galata Sarayı efendileri ( English : Gentlemen of Galata Palace ) , and , after this incident , they adopted that name and started to call their club Galata Sarayı . In 1905 , during the era of the Ottoman Empire , there were no laws for associations so the club could not be registered officially , but , after the 1912 Law of Association , the club registered legally . Since there werent any other Turkish teams , Galatasaray joined the Istanbul League that was consisting of English and Greek teams in the season of 1905–1906 . With their first championship title they won in 1908–1909 , they heralded the beginning of Turkish football history . While football in Turkey began to fully develop , Galatasaray won ten more Istanbul League titles until 1952 . Upon the initiation of professional football in 1952 , the first professional but non-national league of Turkey , Istanbul Professional League , was played between 1952 and 1959 . Galatasaray won three of these seven titles . Türkiye Profesyonel 1 . Ligi ( Turkish Super League today ) formed in 1959 . This is the top-flight professional league in Turkish nationwide football , and the most popular sporting competition in the country . Galatasaray joined all seasons and won 22 league titles since then . The Turkish Football Federation began organizing the Turkish Cup ( today it is organized with the name Ziraat Turkish Cup ) in the 1962–63 season for Turkish clubs to qualify for the UEFA competitions . This is the only national cup competition in Turkey . Galatasaray joined all seasons and won 16 trophies since then . Probably the greatest record that the club holds is winning national championships in 15 different sport branches in the 1986–87 season . Another achievement in this period was reaching the semi-final of the European Cup in the 1988–89 season , making Galatasaray the first and only Turkish team to have played a semi-final in this competition . Galatasarays most successful era came in the late 1990s , when the club become the first and only Turkish football club to win a major UEFA competition . They were aided in this by one of Turkeys best generation of homegrown footballers who went on to finish third in the 2002 FIFA World Cup , after having played in the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2000 . Besides the talented players , visiting teams also disliked traveling into Ali Sami Yen Stadium , literally dubbed Hell by Galatasaray supporters due to the intimidating atmosphere provided by the fans including chants and riots in the crowds . There are many successful footballers who have played for Galatasaray and made their mark on Turkish football history . The teams legendary players include Nihat Bekdik nicknamed Aslan ( Lion ) ; the 1930s national hero Eşfak Aykaç ; Boduri who died aged 21 ; Mehmet Leblebi who scored a domestic record of 14 goals in a single match ; Gündüz Kılıç nicknamed Baba ( Father ) who was the coach but also the player of his team in the 1950s , with great success in both duties ; Bülent-Reha Eken brothers ; Suat Mamat who scored three goals in the 1954 FIFA World Cup ; Coşkun Özarı who devoted his life to Galatasaray ; Turgay Şeren the heroic goalkeeper who was called the Panther of Berlin ; Fatih Terim , the team captain of Galatasaray and Turkish national football team for many years , who won the UEFA Cup in 2000 as the teams coach ; Metin Oktay the legendary six-time top-scorer of the Turkish Super League ; Zoran Simović , another skilled goalkeeper known for his penalty saves ; Cüneyt Tanman who played a record of 342 games for Galatasaray ; Tanju Çolak , an extraordinary goalscorer and the 1988 European Golden Boot winner with Galatasaray ; Cevad Prekazi , an Albanian teammate of Tanju Çolak specializing in free kicks ; Cláudio Taffarel the World Cup-winning goalkeeper for Brazil ; Gheorghe Hagi , the Romanian football hero who is still described as the best foreign player ever to play in Turkey ; Brazilian striker Mário Jardel , dubbed Super Mário by the fans and scored both of Galatasarays two goals in the 2000 European Super Cup Final against Real Madrid ; and last , but not least , Hakan Şükür , the player who scored most goals in Süper Lig history with 249 . Name and pronunciation . Galatasaray ( ) is a quarter in Karaköy in the Beyoğlu district of Istanbul , located at the northern shore of the Golden Horn . Its name comes from that of Galata , which may in turn have derived from Galatai ( meaning the Galatians ) , as the Celtic tribes were thought to have camped at Galata during the Hellenistic period before settling in Galatia in central Anatolia . Galatasaray translates directly as Galata Palace ( saray means palace in Persian ) . Galatasaray High School , established in the area in 1481 , was the progenitor of Galatasaray S.K . as well as other institutions of Galatasaray Community . Galatasaray is a compound word and is pronounced as such , with a very brief pause between the two words . There is no diminutive form of the clubs name . Fans refer to the club either by its full name or by its nickname Cim-Bom ( -Bom ) , ) —of uncertain etymology . However , the shortened form Gala is sometimes used by English speakers . Crest and colours . Galatasarays first emblem was drawn by 333 [ School Number ] Şevki Ege . This was the figure of a spread-winged eagle with a football in its beak . The eagle was a model emblem that Galatasaray dwelled on in the beginning . But when the name did not attract too much interest , Şevki Eges composition was pushed aside . It was replaced by the current design in the 1920s . This replaced in 1925 by the current Ghayn-Sin crest , which are the first two Arabic letters of Galata Saray , designed by Ayetullah Emin . At first , the colours of Galatasaray were red and white . These are the colours in the modern Turkish flag . The Turkish Republic , however , was not founded at that time . Therefore , this decision caused the repressive administration of the day to feel uncomfortable and the administration subsequently pressured the footballers . For this reason , on December 26 , 1906 the colors were changed to yellow and black . The eight-piece halved design kit was ordered from the Sports Outfitter William Shillcock based in Birmingham , United Kingdom . After a heavy 0-5 loss to Baltalimanı in a friendly match the new colours yellow and black were counted as inauspicious . On 6 December 1908 , for a match against the football team of the Royal Navy cruiser , Galatasaray finally settled on playing in red and yellow , inspired by the roses which Gül Baba offered to Sultan Bayezid II . Ali Sami Yen stated , After we have been in and out of several shops , we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fatty Yankos store at Bahçekapısı ( between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul , now called Bahçekapı ) . One of them was quite dark red , resembling the cherry color , and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange . When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us the beauty of a goldfinch . We thought we were looking at the colors flickering in burning fire . We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories . Indeed it did . Home kit . The Galatasaray home kit have always been fundamentally the same since 1908 . The traditional shirt of Galatasaray is the eight-piece halved design . This consists of the shirt’s front , back and sleeves being made up of two colours , resulting in the shirt being split into eight parts . ( Two same colours are never next to each other within the 8 parts. ) The colours continue in an alternating order , from yellow to red . This results in the front of the shirt being the opposite of the back and the shirt also having an halved design from the side . This alternating colour order of eight parts creates a complete halved design for the shirt . The classic eight-piece halved design would become the look of Galatasaray for around 80 years , until 1985 when sportswear manufacturer Adidas began to provide the shirts and the sleeves were made up by one colour and not halved . Created over a century ago , the classic Galatasaray kit combination consists of the eight-piece halved traditional shirt , white shorts and red socks and are usually worn as part of the home strp . This changed in the mid-1980s , when sportswear manufacturer Adidas began to provide the shirts . The club reverted to the classic kit in 2012 . The official colours are Pantone shades 1235 ( yellow ) and 201 ( red ) . Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors . Galatasarays kit is manufactured by Nike , who have held the contract since 2011 . Previous kit manufacturers have been : Çamlıca ( 1978–79 ) ; Adidas ( 1978–82 , 1984–91 , 1995–2001 , and 2005–11 ) ; Umbro ( 1979–81 , 1982–83 , 1991–95 , and 2002–05 ) ; Puma ( 1980–81 ) ; Gola ( 1981–82 ) ; Fatih ( 1984–85 ) ; and Lotto ( 2001–02 ) .

Grounds . Ali Sami Yen Stadium . When Galatasaray were formed no Turkish teams had their own home ground , and all games in the Istanbul Football League took place at Papazın Çayırı – now the site of Fenerbahçes Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium . In 1921 the citys first proper football stadium was constructed , Taksim Stadium , which was used as the home ground for all of Istanbuls teams . When historic Taksim Stadium was demolished in 1940 , Galatasaray decided to build a large , modern stadium . Due to difficulties stemming from World War II , construction was delayed for over two decades . In this period , they played in Şeref Stadi and Dolmabahçe Stadi On 20 December 1964 , Ali Sami Yen Stadium opened . Named after the founder of Galatasaray , Ali Sami Yen , it is in the Mecidiyeköy quarter of the Şişli district at the center of the city . In 1964 , the stadium had capacity over 35,000 . Due to improvements in security and prohibition of non-seater spectators , the all-seater capacity reduced to 22,000 in 1993 . A few years later , the rebuilt of main stand , which was damaged by an earthquake , slightly increased the capacity . After 2002 , when Atatürk Olympic Stadium was built for Istanbuls Olympic Games bid , Galatasaray started to play European Cup matches there . The attendance record among Turkish stadiums was broken there , in Galatasaray–Olympiacos match played in front of 79,414 spectators . Yet , Ali Sami Yen Stadium has historic importance for Galatasaray fans although it is smaller and older . The stadium was in 2011 demolished after Galatsaray moved to the newly built Türk Telekom Stadium . Türk Telekom Stadium . The new home ground of Galatasaray is the newly built Türk Telekom Stadium in the Seyrantepe area of Sarıyer . It is also known as Ali Samiyen Spor Kompleksi . The new stadium , which was opened 15 January 2011 , has a capacity of 52,223 seats , making it the largest private stadium used by a club in Turkey . Stadium anthems . Since 1992 , after every goal scored by Galatasaray , the last part of the song I Will Survive by the Hermes House Band is played . Although the song is in English , the part used has no lyrics except la la la la . In addition , before every game the Galatasaray War Chant is played accompanied by what the fans call a scarf show where fans display and wave their Galatasaray scarves , banners and flags . Many people call the Turk Telekom Stadium Cehennem ( hell ) because of stadium anthems and the continuous roar of the fans . Support . European matches . Galatasaray fans attach high importance to European competitions , and Galatasaray is known as the Conqueror of Europe by their fans . This nickname underlines the importance of the UEFA Cup and Super Cup Galatasaray managed to win during the 1999–2000 season . Galatasaray fans also have a reputation in Europe as being one of the most fanatic in the world , along with ultrAslan . Ryan Giggs once said &lt;nowiki&gt;Ive never experienced anything like Galatasaray . Three hours before kick-off , we went out to have a look at the pitch and the stadium was overcrowded ! The chanting was brilliant : one side starts , then the other , then quiet , then all of them chanting ! The players really enjoyed it . Before it was good , after it wasnt for us.&lt;/nowiki&gt; Record . Galatasaray fans broke the loudest crowd roar at a sport stadium record on 18 March 2011 at Galatasarays new stadium Türk Telekom Stadium in Istanbul . A peak reading of 140.76 dBA was recorded . Popularity of Galatasaray in Turkey . The poll in June 2012 placed Galatasaray in the first place with a 41.8% level of popularity while Fenerbahçe S.K . comes second with a 35.9% level , Beşiktaş J.K . third with 16.3% and Trabzonspor fourth with 4.7% . The same result was announced in another poll dated September 2019 which included a sample of 7500 Turkish people . Istanbul derbies . The big three clubs of Istanbul – Beşiktaş , Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray – have a century-long history of rivalry . The Galatasaray–Fenerbahçe rivalry is the primary Istanbul derby and the most important rivalry in Turkish football . The rivalry poses a symbolic importance to supporters due to an assumed superiority that comes with winning the derby . Supporters are often quoted as stating that winning the league without winning the derby is hollow . There is always huge interest in the derby due to its fierce nature on and off the pitch . Many documentaries have been made about the derby including an episode of The Real Football Factories International . The rivalry has led to violence among supporters on numerous occasions , though this has been on the decline in recent years . The typical features of derby days include sell out stadiums , loud support throughout the match and taunting choreography displays by supporters before kick off . Other top level İstanbul derbies include the teams ; İstanbul BB and Kasımpaşa although these teams pose a minor rivalry as the history and the nationwide attention to the derbies among the big three is unmatched . Torches , smoke , drums , flags and giant posters are used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on visiting teams , which fans call welcoming them to hell . Honours .

(football) from 1905 to 1907?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: Galatasaray Spor Kulübü ( , Galatasaray Sports Club ) is a professional football club based on the European side of the city of Istanbul in Turkey . It is the association football branch of the larger Galatasaray Sports Club of the same name , itself a part of the Galatasaray Community Cooperation Committee which includes Galatasaray High School where the football club was founded in October 1905 consisting entirely of student members . The team traditionally play in dark shades of red and yellow at home , with the shirts split down the middle between the two colours . Galatasaray SK was founded in October 1905 ( the exact day is disputed , but is traditionally accepted as 17 Teşrinievvel 1321 according to the Rumi calendar , which corresponds to 30 October 1905 according to the Gregorian calendar ) by albanian Ali Sami Yen and other students of Galatasaray High School ( a high school in Istanbul which was established in 1481 ) as a football club . Ali Sami Yen became Galatasaray SKs first president and was given the clubs membership number 1 . The teams first match was against Cadi-Keuy FC and Galatasaray won this match with a score of 2–0 . There were discussions about the clubs name , in which some suggested Gloria ( victory ) and others Audace ( courage ) , but it was decided that its name would be Galatasaray . According to researcher Cem Atabeyoğlu , Galatasaray took its name from one of its first matches . In that match , Galatasaray won 2–0 over a local Greek club , and the spectators called them Galata Sarayı efendileri ( English : Gentlemen of Galata Palace ) , and , after this incident , they adopted that name and started to call their club Galata Sarayı . In 1905 , during the era of the Ottoman Empire , there were no laws for associations so the club could not be registered officially , but , after the 1912 Law of Association , the club registered legally . Since there werent any other Turkish teams , Galatasaray joined the Istanbul League that was consisting of English and Greek teams in the season of 1905–1906 . With their first championship title they won in 1908–1909 , they heralded the beginning of Turkish football history . - Tekil , S . ( 1986 ) . History of Galatasaray , 1905–1985 .

Niasse has played top-flight football in Senegal , Norway , Turkey , Russia and England . He won the 2011 Senegal Premier League with Ouakam and scored in Lokomotiv Moscows win in the 2015 Russian Cup Final . He signed for Everton for a £13.5 million transfer fee in 2016 . Niasse made his full international debut for Senegal in 2013 . Club career . Ouakam . Born in Ouakam , Dakar Department , Niasse began his football career with hometown club US Ouakam in the second tier . He signed his first professional contract with Ouakam in 2008 and in the 2008–09 season helped his team win the Second League title by scoring 21 goals . Playing as a winger , Niasse also played a key role in Ouakam winning the Senegal Premier League title in 2011 . Niasse started a trial with Norwegian club Brann in February 2012 , and after impressing signed for the club on a six-month loan . His time in Norway was hampered by poor form and injuries , and he returned to Senegal after playing just three Tippeligaen matches . Akhisar Belediyespor . After a trial period with French club Saint-Étienne , Niasse was offered a contract to join the club but refused the offer . He joined the summer camp of Turkish Süper Lig club Akhisar Belediyespor and signed permanently with them in August 2013 . Niasse scored on his debut in Turkey and ultimately finished the season with 15 goals . Lokomotiv Moscow . Before the 2014–15 season , Niasse signed with Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow in July 2014 for a €5.5 million transfer fee . He scored Lokomotivs equalising goal in the Russian Cup Final against Kuban Krasnodar on 21 May 2015 as his side went on to win 3–1 after extra time . Everton . Niasse joined English Premier League club Everton on 1 February 2016 for a transfer fee of approximately £13.5 million , signing a four-and-a-half year contract . He made his debut for the club against AFC Bournemouth on 20 February 2016 , entering as an 80th-minute substitute for striker Romelu Lukaku . After 152 minutes of football in his first season at the club , Niasse was not given a squad number for the following 2016–17 season . He was informed by then-Everton manager Ronald Koeman he would need to search for a new club during the summer 2016 transfer window , saying , [ I ] f Niasse likes to play football he needs to leave Everton . However , following the close of the transfer deadline for loaning and signing players in England , he was listed as part of the 25-man Everton squad for the 2016–17 season submitted on 1 September 2016 and eventually issued squad number 24 . In October 2016 , Niasse was demoted to the under-23 squad and had his personal locker revoked . Loan to Hull City . On 13 January 2017 , Niasse signed a loan contract with Hull City until the end of the 2016–17 season with an option for a £10 million permanent transfer from Everton . He made his debut the next day as an 83rd-minute substitute for Abel Hernández in a 3–1 home win against AFC Bournemouth . His first goal for Hull and in English football came on 26 January in the EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Manchester United , where he made his first start for the club . Hull won the second leg 2–1 but ultimately lost the tie 3–2 on aggregate . Niasse scored his first Premier League goal in a 2–0 victory against Liverpool on 4 February . On 11 March , he came on as a substitute against Swansea City and scored both goals in a 2–1 victory . Hull were relegated to the Championship at the end of the season and opted not to exercise its option to outright purchase Niasse . Return to Everton . After returning to Everton , Niasse made his first appearance since his return as a substitute in the EFL Cup third round match against Sunderland at Goodison Park on 20 September 2017 , scoring Evertons third goal of a 3–0 win . Manager Ronald Koeman named Niasse in Evertons 25-man Premier League squad upon his return from loan and consequently issued him a squad number . However , Koeman omitted Niasse from Evertons UEFA Europa League squad . On 23 September , Niasse scored two goals against AFC Bournemouth in a 2–1 Premier League win , helping Everton to come back from a goal down . On 5 November , Niasse scored Evertons first goal in a 3–2 home win against Watford , having been losing 2–0 . Thirteen days later , he scored in a 2–2 draw away to bottom side Crystal Palace . Niasse sparked controversy in the match by appearing to dive to win Everton a penalty , which was converted by Leighton Baines to make the score 1–1 in the first half . He subsequently became the first Premier League player to be charged with successful deception of a match official under The Football Associations new regulations . Everton appealed the verdict , but the FA rejected the appeal and Niasse received a two-match suspension . Loan to Cardiff City . On 18 January 2019 , Niasse joined fellow Premier League team Cardiff City on loan for the remainder of the season . Return to Everton . Niasse only played 3 Premier League games during the 2019-20 season , failing to start any of them , as Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison were the preferred attacking options . On 26 June 2020 , Everton announced that they had not extended his contract until the end of the extended 2019–20 Premier League , and he was released by the club on 1 July along with teammates Cuco Martina and Luke Garbutt . Huddersfield Town . On 26 March 2021 , after a period of training with the club , Niasse signed for EFL Championship side Huddersfield Town . International career . Niasse was first selected for the Senegal national team in January 2013 as part of an all domestic-based squad . He made his debut on 15 January , starting in a 2–1 friendly loss to Chile in La Serena . On 25 May 2015 , Niasse scored his first international goals , a brace in a 3–1 win over Kosovo at the Stade de Genève . He last played for his country in 2018 , and has appeared nine times in total , scoring three goals . Personal life . His brother , Ibrahima Niasse , is also a professional footballer . Honours .

Early life and Great Northern Railway . He was born in Invercargill , New Zealand , to William Bulleid and his wife Marian Pugh , both British immigrants . On the death of his father in 1889 , his mother returned to Llanfyllin , Wales , where the family home had been , with Bulleid . In 1901 , after a technical education at Accrington Grammar School , he joined the Great Northern Railway ( GNR ) at Doncaster at the age of 18 , as an apprentice under H . A . Ivatt , the Chief Mechanical Engineer ( CME ) . After a four-year apprenticeship , he became the assistant to the Locomotive Running Superintendent , and a year later , the Doncaster Works manager . In 1908 , he left to work in Paris with the French division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a Test Engineer , and was soon promoted to Assistant Works Manager and Chief Draughtsman . Later that year , he married Marjorie Ivatt , Henry Ivatts youngest daughter . A brief period working for the Board of Trade followed from 1910 , arranging exhibitions in Brussels , Paris and Turin . He was able to travel widely in Europe , later including a trip with Nigel Gresley , William Stanier and Frederick Hawksworth , to Belgium , in 1934 , to see a metre-gauge bogie locomotive . In December 1912 , he rejoined the GNR as Personal Assistant to Nigel Gresley , the new CME . Gresley was only six years Bulleids senior . The First World War intervened ; Bulleid joined the British Army and was assigned to the rail transport arm , rising to the rank of Major . After the war , Bulleid returned to the GNR as the Manager of the Wagon and Carriage Works . London and North Eastern Railway . The Grouping , in 1923 , of Britains financially troubled railways , saw the GNR subsumed into the new London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) , and Gresley was appointed the CME . He brought Bulleid back to Doncaster to be his assistant . During this period , Gresley produced the majority of his famous locomotives and innovations , and Bulleid had a hand in many of them , including the P1 2-8-2 freight locomotive , the U1 2-8-0+0-8-2 Garratt freight locomotive , the P2 2-8-2 express locomotive and the A4 4-6-2 express locomotive . Southern Railway and British Railways . In 1937 , Bulleid accepted the post of CME of the Southern Railway ( SR ) at an annual salary of £3,000 , after Richard Maunsell retired . His first contribution to the SR was to oversee the construction of three 350 hp six-wheeled diesel-electric shunters ordered by Maunsell in 1936 ; three were built and proved effective , with an order placed for eight more , though this was cancelled owing to the onset of the Second World War . Between 1949 and 1952 , a further 26 of Bulleids amended version of these locomotives were delivered and later became British Rail Class 12 . In 1938 , Bulleid gained approval to build the Merchant Navy class of modern 4-6-2 Pacifics , undoubtedly inspired by Gresley but also drawing on his experiences from across Europe and with all the most modern equipment : a partially welded boiler and firebox rather than traditional rivetted designs , thermic syphons and a high-pressure boiler . It also included chain-driven valve-gear immersed in an oil bath , a feature that was controversial and later caused problems if not maintained properly , which was difficult , due to conditions , after WW2 . Bulleid , like other engineers , had long felt that it was not ideal to have working parts exposed to the elements , where they were subject to all the dirt thrown up from the track . He also thought that steam engines should get nearer to the internal combustion engine , which enclosed the working parts and used pump lubrication to keep it all running smoothly . Another advantage of enclosing the valve gear would be reduced day-to-day maintenance . Unfortunately , there were design errors in the casing used for the oil bath , which led to leaks . The first Merchant Navy , 21C1 Channel Packet , was built in 1941 and 29 followed , the last being 35030 Elder Dempster Lines . The West Country and Battle of Britain slightly smaller light Pacifics followed in 1945 . 110 were built , of which 21C101 Exeter was the first . His other major steam locomotive design , the Q1 Austerity 0-6-0 freight engine , appeared in 1942 . All steam locomotives designed by Bulleid for the SR had his BFB disc wheels , which gave more even tyre support . This did not eliminate the need for balance weights , but the set-up of the Bulleid valve gear enabled a locomotive with no hammer blow . When the locomotives were rebuilt with Walschaerts valve gear , balance weights were installed in the wheels to reduce hammer blow . Bulleid played a major role in the electrification of the SR , including infrastructure , electric multiple units and electric locomotives . He designed the bodies for the two electric locomotives CC1 and CC2 in 1941 and 1945 . A third example was built by British Railways in 1948 and numbered 20003 . Towards the end of his tenure at the SR , he was responsible for the design and construction of Britains only double-deck passenger trains , the two units of the 4DD class . His final steam locomotive design for the SR was the unconventional Leader , appearing in 1949 , after nationalisation . This had the boiler , coal and water supplies and everything else encased in a smooth double-ended body reminiscent of a diesel locomotive . The drive was through two six-wheel bogies , each with three cylinders . The axles on each bogie were connected by chains . The Leader was innovative but unsuccessful ; after Bulleid had left British Railways , the project was cancelled . Bulleid also had responsibility for coaching stock , an area in which he had an active interest . SR coaches , the newest designed by Richard Maunsell , were solid but old-fashioned . Bulleid designs built on the best of the existing designs , while making improvements , and his coaches were known for their comfort and spaciousness . They were popular with the travelling public , and many of the design features such as the size and layout were used by British Railways for their standard Mark I passenger coaches . Bulleid was briefly the CME of British Railways Southern Region . During this period , his two prototype diesel electric locomotives appeared . Córas Iompair Éireann . In February 1950 , Bulleid was appointed CME of Córas Iompair Éireann ( CIÉ ) , the nationalised transport authority of the Republic of Ireland , having been a consulting engineer to CIÉ since 1949 . He led the first major dieselisation programme , which involved the procurement of diesel multiple units from AEC of Southall ( the 2600 class ) , 94 Crossley-engined diesel locomotives ( 60 CIE 001 Class and 34 CIE 201 Class ) from Metropolitan-Vickers and 12 Sulzer-engined diesel locomotives ( CIE 101 Class ) from the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company . This began a transformation of railway traction in Ireland , although the locomotives proved unreliable until most were re-engined . Bulleid developed two prototype peat-burning steam locomotives , one a converted coal-fired traditional steam locomotive of 2-6-0 wheel arrangement and the other , CC1 , new and fully enclosed , along the lines of the Leader design . CIÉ did not adopt peat-fired traction for widespread use . Recognition and retirement . Bulleid was elected president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 1946 . He was also president of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers and of the Institute of Welding , and was elected to the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers . He was appointed CBE in the 1949 New Year Honours . Bulleid retired in 1958 , moving to Belstone in Devon , then Exmouth . He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science by the University of Bath in 1967 . Shortly after , he moved to Malta , where he died in 1970 aged 87 . His obituary in The Times described Bulleid as the last truly original and progressive mechanical engineer of the steam locomotive era in Britain .

The carriages are of stainless steel , double deck construction , and currently the oldest in the Sydney Trains fleet . Design &amp; construction . The K sets were the first New South Wales suburban trains to be air conditioned and have headlights . Two orders were placed for the K sets with all manufactured in 1981–85 by A Goninan &amp; Co , Broadmeadow : - Order 1 - Order 2 The first order featured low mounted upper deck windows , cream and brown interiors , and unpainted fronts . The second order featured higher mounted upper deck windows , yellow and mustard interiors and State Rail Authority candy livery fronts . The first four trailers were built as driving trailers allowing them to operate in two-car formation , although in practice they were formed into four carriage sets and often ran together as one eight-car set until 1988 . These also differed in the subsequent deliveries in being fitted with air conditioning from new , rather than pressure ventilation . To provide a spare , C3550 &amp; T4216 were also built with air conditioning . All ten carriages were fitted with different windows , being sheet glass with small opening hoppers . This was replaced with sheet glass in 1993 . To accommodate the air conditioning and associated equipment , the pantograph had to be shifted to the adjacent trailer car to which the power car is semi-permanently coupled with high voltage cables connecting the two cars . Although some power cars and trailers have been broken up and married with others during periods of heavy maintenance , many original combinations remain . The control carriages have a flat front , with headlights at the top . They were built with four sets of marker lights , standard at the time . Different combinations of white marker lights were used to indicate different destinations . Flip-dot destination displays were installed later on , which covered the upper middle marker light . Since destination displays have been installed , marker light combinations are no longer necessary , so usually only the two upper marker lights are used . However , some trains still retain the switch for the lower marker light . The front of the train also has an emergency door for the guard compartment and windscreen wipers for the driver window only . Hoses and receptacles are provided below the windows to connect another set , since , unlike newer trains , the coupler does not carry electrical or air connections . Like other trains of the time , the crew compartment contains a smaller compartment for the driver on the left side ( in direction of travel ) . The guard uses the area outside of the drivers compartment , with two manual hinged doors on either side providing access to platforms . Above these doors , on the outside are blue lights indicating which compartment the guard is in . Each vestibule has two-panel sliding doors on either side . Each door also has a vent underneath the window , which was covered when air-conditioning was installed . The doors cannot detect obstacles and continue pushing against the obstruction until it is removed or the guard reopens the doors . Small orange LEDs are located above the doors on the outside that flash when the doors are closing . They assist the guard in locating doors that havent closed successfully . All trains were retrofitted with traction interlocking , meaning the driver cannot apply power when the doors are open . In service . All K sets are crewed with a driver and guard . The guard uses the rear cab on a 2 or 4 car train . On 8 car trains , the guard usually uses the 5th carriage so that the entire platform can be seen . However the 4th carriage cab can also be used if there is a problem with the 5th carriage one.All the K sets were delivered to either Hornsby or Punchbowl depots . With the trials on the ten experimental carriages judged successful , in 1986 a programme commenced to retrofit air conditioning to the second order . This saw the Beclawat windows replaced with sheet glass . It would be July 1990 before the programme was completed . In April 1989 , K sets commenced operating peak-hour services via the North Shore line to Gosford . This was extended to Wyong in January 1992 . In September 1990 , all Punchbowl based sets were transferred to Hornsby . In January 1991 , four sets were transferred to Flemington Maintenance Depot to operate peak-hour Illawarra line services to Port Kembla . To replace U sets on stopping services between Gosford and Newcastle , the sets with driving trailers were remarshaled as two-car sets from October 1996 . Following the delivery of the outer suburban Tangara sets in 1994 , the K sets ceased operating the Central Coast and Illawarra services . During the late 1990s , all were refurbished by A Goninan &amp; Co as part of the CityDecker program . This saw the interiors refurbished with white walls and ceilings , grey floors and blue seats . Power cars received a destination indicator and had yellow applied to the lower half of their fronts . Sliding Beclawat windows on the pressure ventilated cars were replaced with hopper windows and doors painted yellow . The first order was finally retrofitted with air conditioning just prior to the Sydney 2000 Olympics . These cars retained the hopper windows until the late 2000s , but were sealed shut with an adhesive to avoid the loss of air conditioning . After the introduction of a new timetable in October 2009 , all K sets were allocated to Hornsby to operate North Shore , Northern &amp; Western line services , operating in 8-car formations . This was due to the noise levels inside trains when operating on the Epping to Chatswood segment . Older S sets lack sufficient sound insulation for passengers , while newer Tangara sets dont have sufficient cooling in the regenerative braking system to deal with extended shuttle runs through the tunnel . In mid-2014 , K sets are gradually transferred from Hornsby to Flemington resulting in their resumption of service on the Airport , Inner West &amp; South , Bankstown , Carlingford and Olympic Park lines . K60 to K86 were previously running these lines , based out of Flemington Depot . Prior to 2017 , K87-99 continued to run part-time on the T1 North Shore , Northern &amp; Western lines . In October 2013 , the 2 car K Sets ( K1-4 ) were withdrawn from NSW TrainLink Gosford to Newcastle services . The four driving trailers were converted to ordinary trailers at Hornsby and the sets returned to service on Sydney Trains services in March 2014 as K98 and K99 . The existing K98 was renumbered K91 . The driver cabins in these carriages were stripped of controls however the actual walls were kept intact . The doors to the driver cabin are kept locked and the blinds are kept down . There are no passenger seats where the crew compartment used to be . Also , unlike converted S set cars , the round window on the crew compartment doors were removed and covered with a metal plate . In July 2017 , asbestos was found in the circuit breaker panels , which is inside the driver compartment of the K sets , with all withdrawn for inspection for a few weeks . All have since returned to service . After the introduction of a new timetable in November 2017 , all K sets were transferred to Sector 2 . In late 2017 and early 2018 , all K sets and C sets were slightly refurbished with all poles and other safety features repainted yellow . K sets operate on the following lines : - T2 Inner West &amp; Leppington Line : Leppington or Parramatta to City Circle via Granville - T3 Bankstown Line : Liverpool or Lidcombe to City Circle via Bankstown - T8 Airport and South Line : Macarthur to City Circle via Airport or Sydenham They were formerly in operation on the T6 Carlingford line until it was closed in January 2020 .

The PRR used them for freight service on the Northeast Corridor . They continued in service under Penn Central and Conrail until Conrail abandoned its electric operations in the early 1980s . They were then acquired by Amtrak and NJ Transit , where they lived short lives ; all were retired by the mid-1980s . One is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . Design . By the late 1950s , with its P5a fleet aging , the Pennsylvania Railroad needed new electric freight locomotives . In fact , the PRR had never really had a successful electric freight locomotive . The P5a was originally built to haul passengers , being bumped from that duty by the more powerful GG1 . The GG1s were best at hauling passenger trains ; while also adequate for fast , time-sensitive freights , they were not as efficient on heavy freights ( especially coal and ore trains ) , at a time before roller bearings were widely used on freight cars . The PRR had purchased E2b , E2c , and E3b demonstrators , but was not particularly impressed , for a variety of reasons . The railroad even considered complete freight dieselization , and commissioned studies on this from builders Alco , GMs EMD and General Electric ; however , all three builders recommended retaining all existing electrification and acquiring new electric locomotives . The PRR took special note of twelve state-of-the-art EL-C electrics built by GE for the Virginian Railway , who was satisfied with their performance on their coal trains in the Blue Ridge Mountains . The PRR then approached GE about building a similar locomotive , resulting in an order for 66 such units in 1959 . The E44 was essentially a more powerful version of the EL-C ( later known as the E33 ) , with compared to the EL-Cs . One of the most notable differences in appearances between the two locomotives was the pantograph ( s ) : the El-C had one double-arm ( Stemmann ) pantograph , whereas the E44 had two single-arm ( Faiveley ) pantographs , a characteristic born of the PRRs operating practice of having two pantographs per locomotive . The EL-C , while of utilitarian design , also had a slightly more rounded appearance than the rather boxier E44 . While the E44 was short on aesthetics compared with the GG1 and P5 ( bricks being a particularly common sobriquet ) , the units were long on performance . General Electric constructed the first 60 E44s ( 4400-4459 ) using Ignitron rectifiers , and the final six units ( 4460-4465 ) with air-cooled silicon diode rectifiers . GE subsequently upgraded 22 of the units ( a few at a time ) to an E44a designation , boasting upgraded traction motors and silicon rectifier packages for an output of 5,000 horsepower . The 22 E44as were numbered ; the E44a program was terminated in 1970 due to the Penn Central bankruptcy . Conrail subsequently swapped out the Ignitrons in all of the remaining units for silicon diodes in the late 1970s and early 1980s , in-house and without any horsepower upgrades . In 1980 , GE took E44a 4453 in hand for rebuilding with upgraded electronics and uprating to 6,000 horsepower . Made redundant by Conrails discontinuance of electrified freight operations , the rebuilt 4453 was briefly tested on the Northeast Corridor in 1984 by GE , who then scrapped the unit several years later after salvaging the newer components . In the late 1960s , General Electric constructed two upgraded 5,000 horsepower ( 25,000 volt , 60 cycle ) units of the same E44 body style ( known as E50Cs ) for the Muskingum Electric Railroad , a private coal-carrying railroad owned by American Electric Power . Until it closed in 2002 , MERR shuttled coal in two automated consists from the mine to a powerplant at Relief , Ohio ( across from Beverly , OH ) . History . Pennsylvania Railroad . The Pennsylvania took delivery of 66 E44s between 1960–63 and they quickly displaced the P5s . The Pennsylvania used the E44s on just about any freight assignment imaginable , on all of its electrified lines . They could work both singly or lashed together as multiple units . They quickly proved to be very versatile and could handle just about any train , without helpers . The E44s dynamic braking , a novelty under PRR wires , made them just as sure-footed descending grades as climbing them ( although the brakes were not regenerative ) . They even occasionally hauled passenger trains in emergencies , although they were not very adept in this role , being ( officially ) limited to , having a pronounced oscillating tendency at speed on jointed rail , and of course lacking steam generators for passenger service . The units were delivered in an entirely new paint scheme . While adorned in the familiar PRR Brunswick Green , the units carried the sans-serif road name in yellow , flanked by two small PRR keystones , together with a keystone on the front and rear , and a large yellow road number . This scheme was unique to the E44 ; all subsequent diesel orders omitted the road name . The impact of the lettering was diminished by the fact that the units were seldom washed and became very grimy , due to the assignment of the units to diesel service facilities whose automatic car washers lacked overhead wiring . Penn Central and Conrail . After the 1968 Penn Central merger , the E44s remained in freight service , over the same territory as before , and ( unlike much of the Penn Central diesel fleet ) , as reliably as before . The paint scheme for most units was Penn Central black with the worms in love logo . At least one unit wore the short-lived red-P logo , with the P in the logo red instead of white . Not all units received a full Penn Central paint scheme , mainly due to the cash-strapped nature of the railroad , which went bankrupt in June 1970 . For example , some had white PC numbers and small worms on the ends , while a few never received any new lettering at all , instead having all their PRR markings simply patch-painted over except for their yellow numbers . In 1976 , they were passed to the newly formed Conrail . However , things changed when Conrail eliminated their electrification in 1981 . All 66 E44s were retired at that time , though some units were already stored due to economic downturn ; no unit had ever been retired or seriously wrecked . Most , though not all , of the E44s got to be repainted blue with Conrails white wheel on rail logo . Amtrak and NJ Transit . Despite their versatility , the E44s were suddenly about to be used in something they were never intended for : passenger service . Amtrak and New Jersey Transit , both short of electric locomotives , saw in the E44s an opportunity to obtain needed power at bargain-basement prices Amtrak painted them in its standard switcher paint ( gray body with black lettering ) , and switching work was mostly what they ended up doing . They did this adeptly for some years , until Amtrak decided maintaining these aging locomotives was not worth it . The PCB-laden coolant in their transformers also cut short their lives . Many were stored at Wilmington Shops in Wilmington , DE during the early to mid-1990 and they were eventually scrapped . It is not certain what exactly NJ Transit was looking for , but it evidently was not the E44 . All were sold to Amtrak . Like many of NJ Transits second-hand locomotives , their paint scheme was the previous owner ( Conrail ) s herald being painted out , and NJDOT ( New Jersey Department of Transportation ) written below the number . Preservation . PRR 4465 , the final production E44 , is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . 4465 was completed in July 1963 , and later saw service with Amtrak as No . 502 .</p><p>question: What operated Pennsylvania Railroad class E44 from Feb 1968 to Mar 1976?</p><p>pred: Penn Central</p><p>context_time: After the 1968 Penn Central merger , the E44s remained in freight service , over the same territory as before , and ( unlike much of the Penn Central diesel fleet ) , as reliably as before .

Originally they were designed by S . D . Holden , but were much rebuilt , resulting in several subclasses . Seventy-one S69 locomotives were built between 1911 and 1921 and numbered 1500–1570 . Fifty-one of these were built at the GERs Stratford Works and the remaining 20 by William Beardmore and Company . A further 10 locomotives were built by Beyer , Peacock and Company for the LNER in 1928 and numbered 8571–8580 . From 1948 the British Railways numbers were 61500–61580 ( with gaps ) . Background . At the time of their introduction , the Claud Hamilton 4-4-0s were becoming outclassed on the heaviest express . Although an enlarged 4-4-0 design was mooted , it was realised that any such design would have too high an axle load for the tracks of the Great Eastern Railway , which had a relatively low restriction . Another design constraint was the short turntables used at the time . This meant that a 4-6-0 design was decided upon , although the design was relatively short compared to similar designs introduced at the same time . LNER . Seventy were still in service at the 1923 grouping , the LNER adding 7000 to the numbers of nearly all the ex-Great Eastern locomotives , including the Class S69 locomotives . A further ten were ordered in 1928 to ease a power shortage caused by the stalled development on a new class of 4-6-0 locomotives , and the cancellation of the planned suburban 2-6-4T tank locomotive due to the adverse press publicity caused by the Sevenoaks derailment . All the B12 locomotives were fitted with vacuum ejectors between 1924 and 1929 ( the 1928 batch had them from new ) . Fifty-five locomotives were fitted with ACFI feedwater heaters between 1927 and 1934 , but these were removed between 1934 and 1942 . The first substantive change was the fitting of Lenz poppet valves to the 1928 batch ( from new ) , and six of the ex-GE locomotives ( 8516/19/25/32/33/40 ) . These locomotives were then classified as class B12/2 . The poppet valves were not a great success and they all reverted to or were converted to piston valve engines between 1931 and 1934 . As newer power became available , the locomotives’ low axleload made them ideal candidates for transfers elsewhere . consequently , between 1931 and 1942 , twenty-five locomotives were transferred to Scotland for use on the former Great North of Scotland Railway lines . Starting in 1932 , a programme began of rebuilding the B12 locomotives with larger diameter boilers . The Diagram 99A boilers utilised were diameter , compared with the diameter originals . These rebuilt locomotives were classified as class B12/3 , and as they had a higher axleload , none of the Scottish-allocated locomotives were included . The last to be rebuilt was 8549 in 1944 , leaving 8534 as the last English B12/1 ; but it was withdrawn the following year without being rebuilt . As the Scottish locomotives also required new boilers , a new design was started in 1941 , based on the old design but with a round-topped firebox and other detail changes . Thirty of these Diagram 25A boilers were manufactured at Doncaster and Stratford between 1942 and 1946 . Nine were sent to Inverurie Works for fitting to B12 locomotives , the remainder went to Stratford for fitting to class J20 locomotives .

It was created in 1896 for Empress Alexandra Feodorovna . The egg currently resides in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts . Design . The egg was created by Faberges workmaster , Mikhail Evlampievich Perkhin ( Russian , 1860–1903 ) with miniatures by Johannes Zehngraf ( Danish , 1857–1908 ) It stands about 248 mm ( 9 3/4 in ) tall on its stand , with a diameter of 98 mm ( 3 7/8 in. ) The outer shell is rock crystal banded with emerald-green enameled gold studded with diamonds . On the apex of the egg is a Siberian emerald supported by an emerald-green enameled gold mount . This cabochon-style emerald is one of the largest gemstones Fabergé used in any of the Imperial eggs . The eggs base sits on a plinth of rock crystal . The base consists of a colorfully enameled gold double spheroid which is circled twice with rose-cut diamonds . It has the monograms of the Tsarina , as the Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt before her marriage , and later as Alexandra Fedorovna , Empress of Russia . Each monogram is surmounted with a diamond crown of the respective royal house . These monograms form a continuous pattern around the base of the egg . Surprise . Inside the rock crystal egg is a gold support holding twelve miniature paintings . The paintings are of the various palaces and residences that were significant to the Empress . Each location holds a special memory for Nicholas and Alexandra in the early days of their courtship , as they had just been married two years prior , in 1894 . When the large cabochon emerald on the apex is depressed it engages a mechanism that rotates the miniatures inside the egg . A hook moves down and folds the framed pictures back , like the pages of a book , so two paintings can be fully seen at one time . Each miniature is framed in gold with an emerald on the apex . The frames are attached to a central fluted gold shaft which passes vertically through the egg . The locations include : - New Palace Darmstadt : The palace in which the princess was born . - Kranichstein , Hesse , hunting château Kranichstein : A favorite summer residence of the Empress youth . - Balmoral Castle , Scotland : Childhood holiday destination of Alexandra , owned by her grandmother Queen Victoria . - Veste Coburg ( Coburg Fortress ) , Coburg : The palace where Nicholas and Alexandra were engaged to be married , during the wedding of Alexandras brother Ernie , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse to Victoria Melita , Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1894 . - Wolfsgarten , Hesse : Hunting lodge Alexandras family visited as a child . - Windsor Castle , near London , England : A residence of Queen Victoria where Alexandra visited as a child . - Cathcart House ( and West Park United Reformed Church ) , Harrogate , UK : Boarding House where Alexandra stayed while taking the baths in Harrogate and where she became godmother to the just born Allen twins . - Schloss Rosenau , Coburg : A site Nicholas and Alexandra visited the day after their engagement . - Osborne House , Isle of Wight : Site of Nicholas visit to see Alexandra while they were engaged . - The Winter Palace , St . Petersburg : The site of Nicholas and Alexandras wedding . - Anichkov Palace , St . Petersburg : Residence of Maria Feodorovna , where Alexandra spent her first year in Russia . - The Alexander Palace , Tsarskoe Selo , near St . Petersburg : the Imperial familys favorite winter residence . History . The egg was presented by Nicholas II to Alexandra Fedorovna on March 24 , 1896 . She received it at Eastertide in the same year that the young couple had suddenly ascended the throne . In 1909 , the egg was housed in the Empress study in the Winter Palace . The egg was seized by the Kerensky Provisional Government and moved to the Armory Palace of the Kremlin in Moscow along with approximately 40 other eggs . In 1930 , the Rock Crystal Egg was one of the ten Eggs sold by the Antikvariat ( Trade Department ) to the Hammer Galleries in New York City for 8000 rubles , or approximately $4000 U.S . In 1945 the egg became the last of five Imperial Easter Eggs bought by Lillian Thomas Pratt , the wife of a General Motors executive John Lee Pratt . Upon Lillian Thomas Pratts death in 1947 , the egg was willed to Virginia Museum of Fine Arts , Richmond , Virginia . It remains on view as part of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts European Decorative Art collection .

J . Hill ( H88 ) for the Great Eastern Railway . They were given the nickname Claud Hamilton after the pioneer engine of the class , named after Lord Claud Hamilton ( 1843–1925 ) the chairman of the Great Eastern Railway . The D56 class of 1903-4 evolved the design to include a square-topped Belpaire firebox . The H88 class of 1923 featured a larger superheated boiler , leading them to be known as Super Clauds . Many earlier members of the class were rebuilt during their working life . During the Edwardian era , they were the flagship express locomotive on the Great Eastern Main Line , and although displaced on the heaviest express trains by the larger S69 class from 1911 ( itself a 4-6-0 development of the Claud design ) , members of the class were used on passenger and goods services throughout the Eastern Region until 1960 . No locomotives of the three classes survived to preservation . Design . The Claud Hamilton , particularly in its original GER blue livery , is widely considered one of the most elegant locomotive designs of the pre-grouping era . In his 1955 history of the Great Eastern Railway , Cecil J . Allen devotes a whole chapter to the class and noted that Of all the locomotive designs that emerged from Stratford Works during the reign of James Holden , the one destined to achieve the greatest fame , beyond question , was his Claud Hamilton type 4-4-0 , of which the pioneer example , No . 1900 Claud Hamilton , took the rails in 1900 . Although credited to James Holden , the Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Eastern , Frederick Vernon Russell ( Holdens Chief Designer ) is thought to have contributed substantially to the design of the Claud Hamiltons ; while researching his Some Classic Locomotives of 1949 , C.H . Ellis was informed by Russell that during the process of designing the locomotive Mr Holden , by then a valetudinarian was making a long recuperative stay in Egypt . The 4-4-0 inside cylinder locomotive included a number of features that were to appear on later Great Eastern locomotive classes , including a circular polished steel smokebox door surround ( instead of the usual horizontal straps ) and decorative splashers . Class pioneer No 1900 Claud Hamilton featuring red lining and connecting rods , copper chimney cap and GER coat of arms was much admired when it was exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exposition . The original S46 boiler had of heating surface , with a grate . The cylinders were 19 x 26 in . with flat valves placed below , operated by Stephensons motion . The coupled wheels were in diameter . Allen reports that Claud Hamiltons in their original state were capable of taking around 350 tons from Liverpool Street to North Walsham in under the booked time . No . 1882 with round-top boiler ran the in 156 min 60 sec . Even heavier trains were managed in the up direction : No . 1809 ( Belpaire boiler ) took 400 tons up in 157 minutes 24 seconds . The S46 design was substantially modified in later incarnations , particularly with the introduction of a larger superheated boiler on the H88 designed by Alfred John Hill . Most earlier members of the class were substantially modified by Hill or during the tenure of Sir Nigel Gresley as CME of the LNER from 1923 . Two separate classes were also developed from the design of the Claud Hamilton ; Holdens Class F48 ( constructed between 1900 and 1903 ) was essentially an 0-6-0 goods version of the S46 and the Class S69 ( built between 1911 and 1921 ) was a larger 4-6-0 version using many of the same design cues as the H88 , built to replace the Clauds on the heaviest express trains . Classification and numbering . The classification of the Claud Hamiltons is complex but is summarised here : - GER Class S46 ( LNER Class D14 ) , 4 ft 9 in diameter boiler , round-top firebox - GER Class D56 ( LNER Class D15 ) , 4 ft 9 in diameter boiler , Belpaire firebox - LNER Class D15/1 , D15 as built with short smokebox , some with superheater - LNER Class D15/2 , D15 with superheater and long smokebox - GER Class H88 ( LNER Class D16 ) , Super Claud with superheater , larger boiler ( 5 ft in diameter ) and Belpaire firebox - LNER Class D16/1 , D16 as built ( with short smokebox ) - LNER Class D16/2 , as D16/1 but with extended smokebox - LNER Class D16/3 , Gresley rebuild of D15 and D16 with round-top firebox , some with piston valves The class pioneer was numbered 1900 ( to coincide with the year the locomotive was built ) , with subsequent batches numbered backwards in tens as follows : The Railway Magazine of November 1923 includes the log of a run from Liverpool Street to Ipswich with 4-4-0 number 1780 , so this loco at least must have carried a GER number . Appearance . Originally painted in GER blue with red lining and bronze highlights , following the 1923 grouping the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway , and were painted in the companys apple green with LNER on the tender and cab-side numbers . Side rods were polished steel . The appearance was altered when a larger boiler and Belpaire firebox was fitted , meaning a change in the cab window shape as well . 8783 and 8787 were kept in immaculate condition as dedicated Royal locos for hauling the Royal Train from Kings Cross to Wolferton ( the nearest station for Sandringham House ) . 8783 was also fitted with a copper-capped chimney . Later some locos carried numbers and London &amp; North Eastern Railway on the tender . During the Second World War most were repainted into unlined black livery with the letters N E on the tender . Royal Claud 8783 retained its LNER apple green livery into British Railways days ( after 1948 ) , but with BRITISH RAILWAYS on the tender initially . Others were painted black with BRITISH RAILWAYS on the tender . Later on they carried both lined and unlined black with the early BR crest and those which survived after 1956 lined and unlined black with the later crest . Many of the class retained steel smokebox door rings until withdrawal , except those rebuilt by Gresley with a larger boiler which also required a new smokebox . Many locos had their decorative valances removed in later years as well , though they still retained their distinctive character . Accidents and incidents . - On 1 January 1915 , locomotive No . 1813 was hauling an express passenger train that overran signals and collided with a local passenger train at , Essex . Ten people were killed and more than 500 were injured . - On 12 February 1927 , locomotive No . 8808 was hauling an express passenger train that was in collision with a lorry on a level crossing at Tottenham , London . Due to foggy conditions , the train was not travelling at a high speed . - On 17 January 1931 , locomotive No . 8781 was running light engine at Great Holland , Essex when it was in a head-on collision with a newspaper train . Two people were killed and two were seriously injured . The newspaper train had departed from station against signals . - In November 1934 , D16/2 8783 locomotive was derailed at Wormley , Hertfordshire when it collided with a lorry on a level crossing . Both engine crew were killed . - On 1 June 1939 , locomotive No . 8783 was hauling a passenger train that collided with a lorry on an occupation crossing at , Norfolk and was derailed . Withdrawals . Withdrawals of the class began in 1945 , with the final member , a D16/3 , scrapped in 1960 leaving no survivors of the class . Revival . A group based at the Whitwell &amp; Reepham railway plan to build a replica of D16/2 No . 8783 to be named Phoenix . In fiction . The design was the basis of the character Molly in the childrens TV series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends .

Koch directs the venture capital company Koch Disruptive Technologies , and is a leading figure in Koch Industries and the familys philanthropic activities . Early life and education . Koch , who is named after his grandfather and father , was born on June 15 , 1977 and raised in Wichita , Kansas , by his parents , Charles and Liz . Every Sunday , Charles Koch would educate Chase and his sister Elizabeth about his value system , libertarian economics , and philosophy . According to a 2018 profile in Politico , Chases interest in education is rooted in that childhood tutoring , which involved listening to recordings of F.A . Hayek and Milton Friedman and discussing “values like courage and equal rights.” Charles Koch expected Chase and Elizabeth to do everything to the best of their abilities . Chase played basketball at the local YMCA and attended Wichita Collegiate School . In his teens , he worked on his familys ranches . His first job , at age 15 , was at Kochs feed yard in Syracuse , Kansas , where he spent the summer digging post holes and shoveling bovine ordure . He later said that although I hated Koch Industries at the time , the experience taught him a critical life lesson about the importance of hard work . In September 1993 , at the age 16 , Koch ran a red light in Wichita as twelve-year-old Zachary Seibert , who was listening to music on his headphones , crossed the street . The car struck the boy , who died shortly thereafter at a local hospital . Chase pled guilty to a charge of misdemeanor vehicular homicide and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service and 18 months of probation . Koch graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with a B.S . in marketing . Koch has spoken of his upbringing in a variety of public speeches . After graduating , he played in a band that covered songs by Led Zeppelin , Phish , and the Grateful Dead while trying to navigate his way into Austins tech startup scene without exploiting his family connections . He told an audience in 2015 that he had seriously considered not pursuing a career in the family business . Business career . At age 25 or 26 , Koch returned to Wichita , where he began to work for Koch Industries . During the next few years , he worked in a series of high-level positions at the company , designed to provide him with an MBA-like experience . In 2006 , Koch began working for Koch Nitrogen Company , serving as a regional manager and in global supply . He was appointed president of Koch Fertilizer in 2013 and later named executive vice president of Koch Agronomic Services . As of 2016 , he was president of Koch Agronomic Services . In 2018 , he became president of the newly founded Koch Disruptive Technologies , Koch Industries venture-capital arm . Under his management , according to Bloomberg News , KDT has invested in sectors outside of Kochs traditional areas of expertise ; among the firms in which he has invested is InSightec Ltd. , which manufactures surgical tools that employ ultrasound . In a January 2019 interview on CNBC , he discussed KDTs interest in investing in principled entrepreneurs and in seeking out technologies that can transform methods of production . Throughout his career at Koch , he has chosen to work in Wichita and not at the firms Washington-area headquarters . Philanthropy . Since working at the family firm , Koch has become increasingly involved in his fathers and uncles political activities . He was present in 2003 when his father held a get-together at Chicagos Peninsula Hotel that marked the beginnings of what would later be known as the Koch network . Koch has organized a philanthropic network , consisting of the adult children of Koch network members , to replace their aging parents and grandparents . When working with this network , reported Politico in 2018 , Koch aims at nonpartisanship and avoids the hard-charging political gamesmanship often identified with the Kochs . Koch told Politico that , rather than becoming involved in political conflict , he preferred to find things that he and his philanthropic collaborators can agree on . His aim , he said , is to be a bridge-builder and an innovator focused on civil society . In 2015 , for example , he was involved in an antipoverty initiative that instructed nonprofits in the principles that helped Koch Industries to thrive . He has expressed concern about urban violence and police shootings and has lent his support to a nonprofit called Urban Specialists . In May 2018 , in Vail , Colorado , Koch led a weekend retreat attended by about two dozen affluent young professionals . Its purpose was to discuss the networks future direction and help solve problems through nonprofits and advocacy work . Koch spoke briefly about the importance of authenticity , emphasizing the significance of the role that personal transformation can play in making an impact on society . His goal , he explained , is to bring people together to address major social problems and to try to help disadvantaged individuals to surmount obstacles and achieve success . The idea that the Kochs might de-emphasize politics , commented Politico , was almost unimaginable to Washington insiders . In January 2019 , he told an interviewer that his public activities were guided by the aims of improving as many lives as possible and unlocking peoples potential . He added that he eschewed partisanship and believed in forming coalitions across the political spectrum . He noted that he was working with people like Van Jones on issues like prison reform . Board memberships . Since 2013 he has been a member of the board of Koch Industries . He is also on the board of the Charles Koch Foundation and chairman of New Leaders , which focuses on innovative and principled ideas for social improvement and professional development . Personal life . In 2010 , Koch married Annie Breitenbach , a former neonatal nurse . They live on a 70-acre property in Wichita that Koch purchased for $3 million in 2010 and have three children . Their oldest son , Charles , was born in 2012 . With Zach Lahn , a former Koch network fundraiser , Breitenbach opened Wonder , a private Montessori-style preschool and grade school on the campus of Wichita State University .</p><p>question: Which employer did Chase Koch work for from 2003 to 2006?</p><p>pred: Koch Industries</p><p>context_time: In 2006 , Koch began working for Koch Nitrogen Company , serving as a regional manager and in global supply .

Kuhn Philip A . Kuhn ( September 9 , 1933 – February 11 , 2016 ) was an American historian of China and the Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History and of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University . Kuhn was praised by his colleagues . Frederic Wakeman described Kuhn as one of the Wests premier China historians . Stanford University historian Harold L . Kahn added that “Every twenty years , like clockwork , Philip Kuhn produces a book that we are required to read . What he says sticks to the ribs and gives much pleasure,” and Yale University historian Peter Perdue wrote that Kuhn shaped the field of Qing history more profoundly than any other scholar of his generation . Personal life . Kuhn was born on September 9 , 1933 in London . He was the elder son of Ferdinand and Delia Kuhn , to whom he dedicated his first book . His father had been bureau chief of the London Office of the New York Times and later served at the Washington Post . His mother was a writer who served as information director of the Office of Community War Services during World War II . Kuhn attended Woodrow Wilson High School and then received his A.B . from Harvard College . In 1954 , Kuhn studied Japanese and Japanese history at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London . He enlisted in the United States Army , serving from 1955 to 1958 . During this period , he studied Chinese and Chinese characters at the Defense Language Institute in California . 1958 , Kuhn received his M.A . from Georgetown University , and 1959 , Ph.D . in History and East Asian Languages at Harvard University , where his dissertation advisor was John K . Fairbank . He married Sally Cheng ( ) in the 1960s and had one son , Anthony Kuhn , a journalist . That marriage dissolved in 1980 . He also had a daughter , Deborah W . Kuhn , with his second wife Mary L . Smith . Academic career . Kuhn taught at the University of Chicago from 1963 to 1978 where he attained the rank of Associate Professor in the Department of History . While at Chicago , Kuhn published in 1970 Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China : Militarization and Social Structure , 1796-1864 as part of the Harvard East Asian monograph series , which led to his being granted tenure and a full professorship . In 1978 Kuhn returned to Harvard , where he succeeded his mentor John King Fairbank . From 1980 to 1986 , Kuhn served as director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies . Impact and evaluations . A pioneer of social history in Chinese history , Kuhn helped re-evaluate the impact-response school of Western scholarship on China associated with his mentor , John Fairbank . Gong Yongmei , a researcher at the Center for China Studies Abroad at East China Normal University , observed that in his early work , Kuhn followed in the steps of his mentors , Fairbank and Benjamin I . Schwartz , but where they saw the modern history of China as a story of decline and stagnation , he stressed the new social and political forms that were created internally , not imported from the west , and that progressed toward modernization . That is , he did not favor either the traditional Chinese framework of the dynastic cycle or the Cold War American framework of Western impact and Chinas response . Kuhns dissertation research started with local militarization that put power in the hands of local gentry at the expense of the central government . This doctoral research resulted in book-length chapters on the Taiping Rebellion in the Cambridge History of China , and his initial book , Rebellion and Its Enemies in Late Imperial China ; Militarization and Social Structure , 1796-1864 , published by Harvard University Press in 1970 . In his influential analysis of American historians of China , Paul A . Cohen says that Rebellion and Its Enemies is a landmark study which begins to modify the line of interpretation which sees Chinas modernization as brought from outside China and outside Chinese tradition and that Kuhn instead addresses the nature of change taking place before the coming of the West . His question is not response to Western imperialism but what was happening in eighteenth century China ? When the Beijing archives of the Qing dynasty became open to American scholars , Kuhn was among the first to spend extended time exploring them . His second monograph , Soulstealers : The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768 ( 1990 ) was centered on an incident of alleged shamanic witchcraft – “soul stealing” – that took place in the spring of 1768 . Reports reached the Qianlong Emperor that wandering sorcerers were stealing the souls of children , laborers , fishmongers , landlords , and the wives of grain transporters by cutting their queues or lapels , igniting panic in the countryside . Outsiders who were suspected of this witchcraft were arrested and tortured , and some were lynched . When skeptical mid-level or provincial bureaucrats initially resisted this local response because they regarded local beliefs as superstitious , the emperor threatened them with punishment or even death if they didn’t find the alleged sorcerers and eradicate this menace to his imperial order . Kuhn uses detailed reports filed by officials at all levels to describe local society and bureaucratic tensions between local , mid-level and central bureaucrats in response to the emperors paranoid demands . Kuhn shows how the Qing bureaucracy worked in order to shed light on the theoretical question first posed by Max Weber on the nature of political power in China . Stanford University historian Harold L . Kahns review in Journal of Asian Studies said that Kuhns mastery of ( and profound affection for ) archival documents-confessions , trial records , court letters , secret ( and not-so-secret ) memorials , above all the vermillion rescripts of the emperor- and his anthropological rummaging in law codes and ritual permit us to follow him into local ecologies of uncertainty in an age of affluence , into an understanding of the fragile , busy , often embattled inner life of the popular soul , into the insecurities of Manchu ethnic sensibility and imperial loathing of the south and its soft blandishments.” Kuhn “constructs a social history of contagion at one level , an operational history of power at another , and then watches with benign irony as the subjects of both intersect at ever-ascending levels of victimization.” The books central theme is the relation between the power of the monarch and the restraining power of the bureaucracy . Pamela Kyle Crossley calls it “certainly one of the most thoughtful , and may well be one of the last , ruminations on the implications of Weberian concepts for studies of the Chinese state.” Kuhn sees the emperorship “locked in uneasy partnership with the bureaucracy,” resisting Webers characterization of Chinese monarchy as a “genuinely autocratic institution,” and argues that the monarchy was able to reposition itself against the bureaucracy until it permanently lost this advantage in the 19th century . Kahn comments that the book shows autocratic power and bureaucratic complacency “fed on each other” and so “reinforced the sinews of the ancien regime,” a position that ran counter to Weber’s notion of mutual incompatibility in a zero-sum battle for power . Jonathan Spences review in Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies also praises Kuhn for drawing attention to the often neglected role of shamanism and sorcery in late imperial China . He lauded Kuhns treatment of hair and magic , especially in the thinking of the Manchu emperors , making the stealing of the queue an especially sensitive issue . The Chinese translation of Soulstealers sold more than 100,000 copies . Some readers saw contemporary relevance . One of the books translators , a history professor at East China Normal University , wrote in a postscript to the 2011 edition that the mass hysteria described in the book has often recurred in China , and that this hysteria reached a peak in the 1960s and 1970s in the unprecedented Great Revolution . One online discussion drew 10,000 comments . One wrote On the rare occasions when a rebellion was successful , that success merely produced another imperial court , and quoted Kuhns book as an explanation : Because the empowerment of ordinary people remains , even now , an unmet promise . Kuhns last book , Chinese among Others : Emigration in Modern Times ( 2008 ) is a comprehensive study of the Chinese diaspora , that is , the historic movement of Chinese out of China . Gong Yongmei notes that a distinctive feature of Philip Kuhn’s scholarship is the importance of interpreting history from a theoretical paradigm... , a characteristic typical of American Chinese studies . In general , advanced theory and interpretative models are two remarkable advantages of American Chinese studies , and these are reflected in the analytical tools Kuhn draws on and the disciplines he borrows from in his research on Chinese immigrants : historical ecology , anthropology , sociology and religious studies . Kuhns students hold professorships at universities in Asia , North America , and Europe , among them : Cynthia Brokaw , Professor of History , Brown University ; Timothy Brook , the Principal of St .

He previously was Prime Minister of France from 1962 to 1968—the longest tenure in the positions history . He had long been a top aide to President Charles de Gaulle ; as head of state , he was a moderate conservative who repaired Frances relationship with the United States and maintained positive relations with the newly independent former colonies in Africa . He strengthened his political party , the Union of Democrats for the Republic ( Union des Democrates pour la République or UDR ) , to make it a bastion of the Gaullist movement . Pompidous presidency is generally held in high esteem by French political commentators . Biography . Georges Jean Raymond Pompidou was born on 5 July 1911 in the commune of Montboudif , in the department of Cantal in central France . After his khâgne at Lycée Louis-le-Grand , where he befriended future Senegalese poet and statesman Léopold Sédar Senghor , he attended the École Normale Supérieure , from which he graduated with a degree of agrégation in literature . He first taught literature at the lycée Henri IV in Paris until hired in 1953 by Guy de Rothschild to work at Rothschild . In 1956 , he was appointed the banks general manager , a position he held until 1962 . Later , he was hired by Charles de Gaulle to manage the Anne de Gaulle Foundation for Down syndrome ( de Gaulles daughter Anne had Down syndrome ) . Prime Minister . Jacques Chirac served as an aide to Prime Minister Pompidou and recalled : He served as prime minister of France under de Gaulle after Michel Debré resigned , from 14 April 1962 to 10 July 1968 , and to this day is the longest serving French prime minister under the Fifth Republic . His nomination was controversial because he was not a member of the National Assembly . In October 1962 , he was defeated in a vote of no-confidence , but de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly . The Gaullists won the legislative election and Pompidou was reappointed as Prime Minister . In 1964 , he was faced with a miners strike . He led the 1967 legislative campaign of the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic to a narrow victory . Pompidou was widely regarded as being responsible for the peaceful resolution of the student uprising of May 1968 . His strategy was to break the coalition of students and workers by negotiating with the trade-unions and employers ( Grenelle conference ) . However , during the events of May 1968 , disagreements arose between Pompidou and de Gaulle . Pompidou did not understand why the President did not inform him of his departure to Baden-Baden on 29 May . Their relationship , until then very good , would be strained from then on . Pompidou led and won the 1968 legislative campaign , overseeing a tremendous victory of the Gaullist Party . He then resigned . Nevertheless , in part due to his actions during the May 1968 crisis , he appeared as the natural successor to de Gaulle . Pompidou announced his candidature for the Presidency in January 1969 . Some weeks later , his wifes name was mentioned in the Markovic affair , thus appearing to confirm her husbands status as a cuckold . Pompidou was certain that de Gaulles inner circle was responsible for this smear . In social policy , Pompidous tenure as prime minister witnessed the establishment of the National Employment Fund in 1963 to counter the negative effects on employment caused by industrial restructuring . President . After the failure of the 1969 constitutional referendum , de Gaulle resigned and Pompidou was elected president of France . In the general election of 15 June 1969 , he defeated the centrist President of the Senate and Acting President Alain Poher by a wide margin ( 57%–42% ) . Though a Gaullist , Pompidou was more pragmatic than de Gaulle , notably facilitating the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community on 1 January 1973 . He embarked on an industrialisation plan and initiated the Arianespace project , as well as the TGV project , and furthered the French civilian nuclear programme . He was sceptical about the New Society programme of his prime minister , Jacques Chaban-Delmas . In 1972 , he replaced Chaban-Delmas with Pierre Messmer , a more conservative Gaullist . While the left-wing opposition organised itself and proposed a Common Programme before the 1973 legislative election , Pompidou widened his presidential majority by including Centrist pro-European parties . In addition , he paid special attention to regional and local needs in order to strengthen his political party , the UDR ( Union des Democrates pour la Ve République ) , which he made a central and lasting force in the Gaullist movement . Foreign affairs . The United States was eager to restore positive relations with France after de Gaulles departure from office . New US President Richard Nixon and his top adviser Henry Kissinger admired Pompidou ; the politicians were in agreement on most major policy issues . The United States offered to help the French nuclear programme . Economic difficulties , however , arose following the Nixon Shock and the 1973–75 recession , particularly over the role of the American dollar as the medium for world trade . Pompidou sought to maintain good relations with the newly independent former French colonies in Africa . In 1971 , he visited Mauritania , Senegal , Ivory Coast , Cameroon , and Gabon . He brought a message of cooperation and financial assistance , but without the traditional paternalism . More broadly , he made an effort to foster closer relations with North African and Middle Eastern countries in order to develop a hinterland including all nations bordering the Mediterranean . Modernising Paris . Pompidous time in office was marked by constant efforts to modernise Frances capital city .

He previously was Prime Minister of France from 1962 to 1968—the longest tenure in the positions history . He had long been a top aide to President Charles de Gaulle ; as head of state , he was a moderate conservative who repaired Frances relationship with the United States and maintained positive relations with the newly independent former colonies in Africa . He served as prime minister of France under de Gaulle after Michel Debré resigned , from 14 April 1962 to 10 July 1968 , and to this day is the longest serving French prime minister under the Fifth Republic . His nomination was controversial because he was not a member of the National Assembly . In October 1962 , he was defeated in a vote of no-confidence , but de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly . The Gaullists won the legislative election and Pompidou was reappointed as Prime Minister . In 1964 , he was faced with a miners strike . He led the 1967 legislative campaign of the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic to a narrow victory . Pompidou was widely regarded as being responsible for the peaceful resolution of the student uprising of May 1968 . His strategy was to break the coalition of students and workers by negotiating with the trade-unions and employers ( Grenelle conference ) . However , during the events of May 1968 , disagreements arose between Pompidou and de Gaulle . Pompidou did not understand why the President did not inform him of his departure to Baden-Baden on 29 May . Their relationship , until then very good , would be strained from then on . Pompidou led and won the 1968 legislative campaign , overseeing a tremendous victory of the Gaullist Party . He then resigned . Nevertheless , in part due to his actions during the May 1968 crisis , he appeared as the natural successor to de Gaulle . Pompidou announced his candidature for the Presidency in January 1969 . Some weeks later , his wifes name was mentioned in the Markovic affair , thus appearing to confirm her husbands status as a cuckold . Pompidou was certain that de Gaulles inner circle was responsible for this smear . While still in office , Pompidou died on 2 April 1974 , at 9 PM , while in his apartment , from Waldenströms macroglobulinemia . His body was buried on 4 April , in the churchyard of Orvilliers , where he had bought an old bakers house which he turned into a weekend home .

They were located in Metairie , Louisiana and played their home games at the Shrine on Airline . The team began play in 1993 as a member of the Triple-A American Association ( AA ) when the Denver Zephyrs relocated to Metairie . They joined the PCL in 1998 . New Orleans has qualified for the postseason on three occasions and has won the PCL championship twice as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros ( 1998 and 2001 ) . At the end of the 2019 season , the team relocated to Wichita , Kansas , where they continue as the Wichita Wind Surge . Initially , the city of New Orleans hoped to bring a Double-A Southern League team to the city and continue operations as the Baby Cakes . However , due to Major League Baseballs reorganization of Minor League Baseball , the league ceased operations in 2021 and the campaign ultimately failed . History . Professional baseball was first played in New Orleans in the late 19th century . The citys longest-running team was the New Orleans Pelicans who played off and on from 1887 to 1977 primarily in the Southern Association . The Pelicans left after the 1977 season , and the city went without a pro team until 1993 . The New Orleans Zephyrs came to Metairie by way of Denver , Colorado , in 1993 . With the arrival of the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball expansion team , the citys Denver Zephyrs were forced to relocate . Louisiana lawyer and business promoter Robert E . Couhig , Jr . led the effort to relocate the team to New Orleans . The Zephyr name was appropriate for New Orleans , too , as the Zephyr Roller Coaster was a popular ride at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park ( which had closed in 1983 ) . The New Orleans Zephyrs remained in the American Association through 1997 . The circuit disbanded following the season , and they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998 . The Zephyrs won the 1998 PCL championship and went on to win the Triple-A World Series against the Buffalo Bisons , 3–1 . The Zephyrs were also slated to participate in the 2001 championship series with the Tacoma Rainiers , but the playoffs were cancelled in the wake of the September 11 attacks , and the teams were named co-champions . The Zephyrs finished out the last portion of their home games for the 2005 Pacific Coast League season three days before Hurricane Katrina hit the City of New Orleans , and though Zephyr Field sustained moderate damage , the team was able to open the 2006 season at home , making them the first professional team in New Orleans to do so after the hurricane . On May 5–6 , 2006 , the Zephyrs and Nashville Sounds participated in a 24-inning game at Nashville , Tennessees Herschel Greer Stadium which was played over the course of two days and lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes . The game matched the longest game , in terms of innings played , in PCL history . The Zephyrs scored once in the eighth inning and once in the ninth , and the teams remained tied through 18 innings before curfew was called . New Orleans won , 5–4 , on the second day on a Wiki González RBI single . The Zephyrs set 12 franchise records , including striking out a league-record 29 times . In 2008 , the Zephyrs season ended three days early due to the approach of Hurricane Gustav . When it became apparent that Gustav would hit the Gulf Coast on September 1 , they cancelled their games of August 30 through September 1 . On September 22 , 2008 , the Zephyrs became the Triple-A affiliate of the Florida Marlins ( now the Miami Marlins ) . In October 2009 , the team unveiled a new logo with the letter Z set against a fleur-de-lis . The Zephyrs rebranded for the 2017 season . A name-the-team contest was held in search of a new team name to be accompanied by a new color scheme and logos by Brandiose . The seven finalist monikers were Baby Cakes , Crawfish , King Cakes , Night Owls , Poboys , Red Eyes , and Tailgators . On November 15 , the team unveiled Baby Cakes as the new team name and purple , green , and gold as the new team colors , as well as a unique promotion to promote the name : any child born in the state of Louisiana during 2017 was eligible for a lifetime pass to Baby Cakes games , and would be entered into a raffle wherein the winner would receive a full four-year tuition to a state college in Louisiana upon their 18th birthday in 2035 . As part of the rebrand , the teams stadium , Zephyr Field , was changed to Shrine on Airline . The name change was met with mixed reactions . Some fans found the new moniker and logos appealing , and the team reported increased merchandise sales after the announcement . Others expressed disappointment in the new name via social media , claiming it to be an unsuitable name for a sports team and that it did not accurately reflect local culture . At the time of the branding announcement , the team noted fan interest in retaining the Zephyrs moniker , but pointed out that the name had relocated from Denver to New Orleans and had no regional ties or significance other than the roller coaster at Pontchartrain Beach which closed in 1983 . On April 14 , 2017 , Baby Cakes pitchers Scott Copeland ( 7 IP ) , Hunter Cervenka ( 1 IP ) , and Brandon Cunniff ( 1 IP ) combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Iowa Cubs . On September 2 , 2019 , the PCL Triple-A New Orleans Baby Cakes played their final game ever as the Baby Cakes on the road against the Oklahoma City Dodgers in Oklahoma City with a 10-1 win over the Dodgers to cap off 27 years of Triple-A baseball in the Big Easy since the team relocated there in 1993 . The team relocated to Wichita , Kansas , in 2020 and re-branded as the Wichita Wind Surge . After the 2021 MiLB reorganization , the team was not invited back as a Triple-A affiliate and was instead invited to serve as a Double-A team . New Orleans hopes to bring a Double-A Southern League team to replace the PCL Triple-A franchise .</p><p>question: New Orleans Baby Cakes was officially named what from 1901 to 1954?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: </p><p>pred_time: New Orleans Baby Cakes</p><p>groundtruth: </p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-24"/wiki/New_Orleans_Baby_Cakes#P1448#1</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/New_Orleans_Baby_Cakes#P1448#1<p>context: New Orleans Baby Cakes The New Orleans Baby Cakes ( formerly the New Orleans Zephyrs ) were a Minor League Baseball team in the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins .

They were located in Metairie , Louisiana and played their home games at the Shrine on Airline . The team began play in 1993 as a member of the Triple-A American Association ( AA ) when the Denver Zephyrs relocated to Metairie . They joined the PCL in 1998 . New Orleans has qualified for the postseason on three occasions and has won the PCL championship twice as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros ( 1998 and 2001 ) . At the end of the 2019 season , the team relocated to Wichita , Kansas , where they continue as the Wichita Wind Surge . Initially , the city of New Orleans hoped to bring a Double-A Southern League team to the city and continue operations as the Baby Cakes . However , due to Major League Baseballs reorganization of Minor League Baseball , the league ceased operations in 2021 and the campaign ultimately failed . History . Professional baseball was first played in New Orleans in the late 19th century . The citys longest-running team was the New Orleans Pelicans who played off and on from 1887 to 1977 primarily in the Southern Association . The Pelicans left after the 1977 season , and the city went without a pro team until 1993 . The New Orleans Zephyrs came to Metairie by way of Denver , Colorado , in 1993 . With the arrival of the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball expansion team , the citys Denver Zephyrs were forced to relocate . Louisiana lawyer and business promoter Robert E . Couhig , Jr . led the effort to relocate the team to New Orleans . The Zephyr name was appropriate for New Orleans , too , as the Zephyr Roller Coaster was a popular ride at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park ( which had closed in 1983 ) . The New Orleans Zephyrs remained in the American Association through 1997 . The circuit disbanded following the season , and they joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998 . The Zephyrs won the 1998 PCL championship and went on to win the Triple-A World Series against the Buffalo Bisons , 3–1 . The Zephyrs were also slated to participate in the 2001 championship series with the Tacoma Rainiers , but the playoffs were cancelled in the wake of the September 11 attacks , and the teams were named co-champions . The Zephyrs finished out the last portion of their home games for the 2005 Pacific Coast League season three days before Hurricane Katrina hit the City of New Orleans , and though Zephyr Field sustained moderate damage , the team was able to open the 2006 season at home , making them the first professional team in New Orleans to do so after the hurricane . On May 5–6 , 2006 , the Zephyrs and Nashville Sounds participated in a 24-inning game at Nashville , Tennessees Herschel Greer Stadium which was played over the course of two days and lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes . The game matched the longest game , in terms of innings played , in PCL history . The Zephyrs scored once in the eighth inning and once in the ninth , and the teams remained tied through 18 innings before curfew was called . New Orleans won , 5–4 , on the second day on a Wiki González RBI single . The Zephyrs set 12 franchise records , including striking out a league-record 29 times . In 2008 , the Zephyrs season ended three days early due to the approach of Hurricane Gustav . When it became apparent that Gustav would hit the Gulf Coast on September 1 , they cancelled their games of August 30 through September 1 . On September 22 , 2008 , the Zephyrs became the Triple-A affiliate of the Florida Marlins ( now the Miami Marlins ) . In October 2009 , the team unveiled a new logo with the letter Z set against a fleur-de-lis . The Zephyrs rebranded for the 2017 season . A name-the-team contest was held in search of a new team name to be accompanied by a new color scheme and logos by Brandiose . The seven finalist monikers were Baby Cakes , Crawfish , King Cakes , Night Owls , Poboys , Red Eyes , and Tailgators .

For work in this field he , along with Marie Skłodowska-Curie ( Marie Curie ) and Pierre Curie , received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics . The SI unit for radioactivity , the becquerel ( Bq ) , is named after him . Biography . Early life . Becquerel was born in Paris , France into a wealthy family which produced four generations of physicists : Becquerels grandfather ( Antoine César Becquerel ) , father ( Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel ) , and son ( Jean Becquerel ) . Henri started off his education by attending the Lycée Louis-le-Grand school , a prep school in Paris . He studied engineering at the École Polytechnique and the École des Ponts et Chaussées . In 1874 , Henri married Lucie Zoé Marie Jamin , who would die while giving birth to their son , Jean . In 1890 he married Louise Désirée Lorieux . Career . In Becquerels early career , he became the third in his family to occupy the physics chair at the Muséum National dHistoire Naturelle in 1892 . Later on in 1894 , Becquerel became chief engineer in the Department of Bridges and Highways before he started with his early experiments . Becquerels earliest works centered on the subject of his doctoral thesis : the plane polarization of light , with the phenomenon of phosphorescence and absorption of light by crystals . Early in his career , Becquerel also studied the Earths magnetic fields . Becquerels discovery of spontaneous radioactivity is a famous example of serendipity , of how chance favors the prepared mind . Becquerel had long been interested in phosphorescence , the emission of light of one color following a bodys exposure to light of another color . In early 1896 , there was a wave of excitement following Wilhelm Conrad Röntgens discovery of X-rays on 5 January . During the experiment , Röntgen found that the Crookes tubes he had been using to study cathode rays emitted a new kind of invisible ray that was capable of penetrating through black paper . Learning of Röntgens discovery from earlier that year during a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences caused Becquerel to be interested , and soon began looking for a connection between the phosphorescence he had already been investigating and the newly discovered x-rays of Röntgen , and thought that phosphorescent materials , such as some uranium salts , might emit penetrating X-ray-like radiation when illuminated by bright sunlight . By May 1896 , after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts , he arrived at the correct explanation , namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself , without any need for excitation by an external energy source . There followed a period of intense research into radioactivity , including the determination that the element thorium is also radioactive and the discovery of additional radioactive elements polonium and radium by Marie Skłodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre Curie . The intensive research of radioactivity led to Becquerel publishing seven papers on the subject in 1896 . Becquerels other experiments allowed him to research more into radioactivity and figure out different aspects of the magnetic field when radiation is introduced into the magnetic field . When different radioactive substances were put in the magnetic field , they deflected in different directions or not at all , showing that there were three classes of radioactivity : negative , positive , and electrically neutral . As often happens in science , radioactivity came close to being discovered nearly four decades earlier in 1857 , when Abel Niépce de Saint-Victor , who was investigating photography under Michel Eugène Chevreul , observed that uranium salts emitted radiation that could darken photographic emulsions . By 1861 , Niepce de Saint-Victor realized that uranium salts produce a radiation that is invisible to our eyes . Niepce de Saint-Victor knew Edmond Becquerel , Henri Becquerels father . In 1868 , Edmond Becquerel published a book , La lumière : ses causes et ses effets ( Light : Its causes and its effects ) . On page 50 of volume 2 , Edmond noted that Niepce de Saint-Victor had observed that some objects that had been exposed to sunlight could expose photographic plates even in the dark . Niepce further noted that on the one hand , the effect was diminished if an obstruction were placed between a photographic plate and the object that had been exposed to the sun , but … dun autre côté , laugmentation deffet quand la surface insolée est couverte de substances facilement altérables à la lumière , comme le nitrate durane … ( .. . on the other hand , the increase in the effect when the surface exposed to the sun is covered with substances that are easily altered by light , such as uranium nitrate .. . ) . Experiments . Describing them to the French Academy of Sciences on 27 February 1896 , he said : One wraps a Lumière photographic plate with a bromide emulsion in two sheets of very thick black paper , such that the plate does not become clouded upon being exposed to the sun for a day . One places on the sheet of paper , on the outside , a slab of the phosphorescent substance , and one exposes the whole to the sun for several hours . When one then develops the photographic plate , one recognizes that the silhouette of the phosphorescent substance appears in black on the negative . If one places between the phosphorescent substance and the paper a piece of money or a metal screen pierced with a cut-out design , one sees the image of these objects appear on the negative .. . One must conclude from these experiments that the phosphorescent substance in question emits rays which pass through the opaque paper and reduce silver salts . But further experiments led him to doubt and then abandon this hypothesis . On 2 March 1896 he reported : I will insist particularly upon the following fact , which seems to me quite important and beyond the phenomena which one could expect to observe : The same crystalline crusts [ of potassium uranyl sulfate ] , arranged the same way with respect to the photographic plates , in the same conditions and through the same screens , but sheltered from the excitation of incident rays and kept in darkness , still produce the same photographic images . Here is how I was led to make this observation : among the preceding experiments , some had been prepared on Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th of February , and since the sun was out only intermittently on these days , I kept the apparatuses prepared and returned the cases to the darkness of a bureau drawer , leaving in place the crusts of the uranium salt . Since the sun did not come out in the following days , I developed the photographic plates on the 1st of March , expecting to find the images very weak . Instead the silhouettes appeared with great intensity .. . One hypothesis which presents itself to the mind naturally enough would be to suppose that these rays , whose effects have a great similarity to the effects produced by the rays studied by M . Lenard and M . Röntgen , are invisible rays emitted by phosphorescence and persisting infinitely longer than the duration of the luminous rays emitted by these bodies . However , the present experiments , without being contrary to this hypothesis , do not warrant this conclusion . I hope that the experiments which I am pursuing at the moment will be able to bring some clarification to this new class of phenomena . Late career . Later in his life in 1900 , Becquerel measured the properties of Beta Particles , and he realized that they had the same measurements as high speed electrons leaving the nucleus . In 1901 Becquerel made the discovery that radioactivity could be used for medicine . Henri made this discovery when he left a piece of radium in his vest pocket and noticed that he had been burnt by it . This discovery led to the development of radiotherapy which is now used to treat cancer . Becquerel did not survive much longer after his discovery of radioactivity and died on 25 August 1908 , at the age of 55 , in Le Croisic , France . His death was caused by unknown causes , but was reported that he had developed serious burns on his skin , likely from the handling of radioactive materials . Honors and awards . In 1889 , Becquerel became a member of the Académie des Sciences . In 1900 , Becquerel won the Rumford Medal for his discovery of the radioactivity of uranium and he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour . The Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities awarded him the Helmholtz Medal in 1901 . In 1902 , he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society . In 1903 , Henri shared a Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie for the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity . In 1905 , he was awarded the Barnard Medal by the U.S . National Academy of Sciences . In 1906 , Henri was elected Vice Chairman of the academy , and in 1908 , the year of his death , Becquerel was elected Permanent Secretary of the Académie des Sciences . During his lifetime , Becquerel was honored with membership into the Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Academy of Berlin . Becquerel was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ( ForMemRS ) in 1908 . Becquerel has been honored with being the namesake of many different scientific discoveries . The SI unit for radioactivity , the becquerel ( Bq ) , is named after him . There is a crater named Becquerel on the Moon and also a crater named Becquerel on Mars .

He discovered an important , previously unknown , class of compounds called metal carbonyls . Education and career . Ludwig Mond was born into a Jewish family in Kassel , Germany . His parents were Meyer Bär ( Moritz ) Mond and Henrietta Levinsohn . After attending schools in his home town , he studied chemistry at the University of Marburg under Hermann Kolbe and at the University of Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen but he never gained a degree . He then worked in factories in Germany and the Netherlands before coming to England to work at the factory of John Hutchinson &amp; Co in Widnes in 1862 . He worked in Utrecht for the firm of P . Smits &amp; de Wolf from 1864 to 1867 and then returned to Widnes . Here he formed a partnership with John Hutchinson and developed a method to recover sulphur from the by-products of the Leblanc process , which was used to manufacture soda ash . In 1872 Mond got in touch with the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay who was developing a better process to manufacture soda ash , the ammonia-soda or Solvay process . The following year he went into partnership with the industrialist John Brunner to work on bringing the process to commercial viability . They established the business of Brunner Mond &amp; Company , building a factory at Winnington , Northwich . Mond solved some of the problems in the process that had made mass production difficult , and by 1880 he had turned it into a commercially sound process . Within 20 years the business had become the largest producer of soda ash in the world . Mond continued to research new chemical processes . He discovered nickel carbonyl , a previously unknown compound and the first-discovered in the class of metal carbonyls , which could be easily decomposed to produce pure nickel from its ores through the Mond process . He founded the Mond Nickel Company to exploit this . Ores from nickel mines in Canada were given preliminary enrichment there and then shipped to Monds works at Clydach , near Swansea , Wales for final purification . Honours and benefactions . Mond supported scientific societies and , with Henry Roscoe , helped to expand the small Lancashire Chemical Society into the nationwide Society of Chemical Industry of which he was elected president in 1888 . He was elected to the Royal Society in 1891 . Abroad , he was elected to membership of the German Chemical Society , the Società Reale of Naples , and the . He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Padua , Heidelberg , Manchester and Oxford and was awarded the grand cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy . He was a benefactor to a number of scientific organisations including the Royal Society , the Italian Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Institution of Great Britain . In his will he left bequests to the town of Kassel and to a number of Jewish charities . In his later years he had built up a collection of old master paintings and he left the greater proportion of these to the National Gallery , London . His wife left a large collection of materials relating to German literature to Kings College , London . The Royal Society of Chemistry awards the Ludwig Mond Award in his honour . A statue of him , designed by Édouard Lantéri ( 1912 ) , stands in front of the former Brunner Mond offices in Winnington , flanked by a statue of Brunner . Family and personal . In October 1866 Mond married his cousin Frida Löwenthal ( 1847–1923 ) in her native town of Cologne . They soon moved to England and had two sons , Robert and Alfred . In 1880 he took British nationality . While he was establishing his business the family lived at Winnington and in 1884 they moved to London . From the early 1890s on , he spent most of his winters in Rome at his home there . This home , the Palazzo Zuccari , was first leased and then ( 1904 ) bought in the name of his wifes friend Henriette Hertz , who developed it into a study centre for the history of art now called Bibliotheca Hertziana . He died in his London home , The Poplars , Avenue Road , near Regents Park . Although he had never practised any religion he was buried with Jewish rites at St Pancras cemetery where his sons erected a mausoleum . His estate was valued at £1 million .</p><p>question: Ludwig Mond worked in  which location from 1864 to 1867?</p><p>pred: Utrecht</p><p>context_time: Ludwig Mond was born into a Jewish family in Kassel , Germany .

The change in ideological orientation of the Milans del Bosch family was completed with his generation ; traditionally , they had been liberal military officers , but during the twentieth century they aligned themselves with reactionary forces . Biography . Early life . His father died when he was three years old . He was raised under the protection of his uncle , Lorenzo Milans del Bosch . He joined the cavalry army at a young age , lived through the Bourbon restoration and embraced the cause of Alfonso XII . Military career . Milans del Bosch fought in the Third Carlist War in 1893 , and in the Tagalog War in the Philippines from 1897 to 1898 , where he coincided with the future dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera . Following the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato , he returned to Spain where , after a few different military and diplomatic posts , he was named assistant to King Alfonso XIII , and raised to the palatial class of honorary royal servants of the Royal Household and Heritage of the Crown of Spain , the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber . He was later posted to Madrid and Morocco , where he was elevated to the rank of lieutenant general . Captain General of Catalonia . On 30 September 1918 , Milans del Bosch was named Captain General of Catalonia . The situation in Catalonia was tense due to the economic crisis caused by the halt of exportations to belligerent countries and by risen prices . The workers movement—led by the National Confederation of Labour—organized itself and fought the gunmen of the Employers Association . Milans gave his support to the employers association and used military methods to repress social conflicts in what is known as the Canadiense strike . He felt he had the support of the upper classes of Catalan society and did not quit his post until King Alfonso , prodded by the , directly ordered his resignation , which Milans tendered on 10 February 1920 . During his tenure , he was invited to ceremonies and wedding banquets by the Barcelona aristocracy . King Alfonso—in compensation for Milans obedience and years of service—named him head of the . Civil Governor of Barcelona . On 26 September 1924 , three months after he left his post at the , Milans del Bosch was named Civil Governor of Barcelona by his friend , Prime Minister Miguel Primo de Rivera . Together with the minister of governance and the Captain General of Catalonia , he carried out a fierce anti-Catalanist campaign . In 1925 , he ordered the closure of FC Barcelonas stadium , Camp Nou , as well as closure of the Orfeó Català ; he banned Catalan cultural organizations and suspended publication of Catalan newspapers and magazines . He was removed from office upon the fall of the dictatorship on 18 February 1930 . Later life and execution . From October 1927 to February 1930 , Milans del Bosch was appointed to the National Advisory Assembly of Primo de Riveras dictatorship . Milans del Bosch chose not to leave Madrid after the attempted of 18 July 1936 that started the Spanish Civil War , as his son Mariano had been detained – though he had the option to take refuge in the Turkish embassy . He was detained by militiamen on 30 August , and executed the following day on Fernando el Santo Street in Madrids district of Chamberí . References . Sources .

The shows format is similar to the one of Whose Line Is It Anyway? . It was first aired on December 31 , 2007 on TV2 , but was not renewed after the first season . The Hungarian public service television ( Magyar Televízió ) and Comedy Central Hungary took Beugró over after its cancellation , but one year later ( in 2009 ) they passed it to Cool TV . In 2011 , Viasat 3 bought the rights of the show but stopped production after only one year . The last episode was aired on January 1 , 2012 . The show had a spring and a fall season each year . In late 2017 , RTL II—one of Cool TVs sister channels—revived the series for a tenth anniversary season . Each episode of the show consists of four actors ( usually Lia Pokorny , Laura Ruttkay , Péter Kálloy Molnár , Győző Szabó , Péter Rudolf and/or Csaba Debreczeny ) who play improvisational games . As stage properties , they usually have nothing but four chairs . The types of games remain similar but the situations always change . The show is hosted by Péter Novák and is directed and produced by Iván Kapitány . History . The beginnings : 2007-2009 . Beugró was based on the idea of co-producer Tamás Szurdi and went through a long preparatory phase . The games came from exercises played at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest and from traditional Hungarian improvisational theatre . After the pilot was accepted the creators watched several international improvisational TV shows ( among others the Whose Line Is It Anyway? ) to determine the final format of the show . The original four actors were Lia Pokorny , Péter Kálloy Molnár , Győző Szabó and Péter Rudolf . The first episode was aired on New Years Eve in 2007 on TV2 . Beugró was both critically acclaimed and popular among audiences so it started as a weekly series on March 14 , 2008 starting at 11 pm ( CET ) . In the meantime the pilot episode , which was never aired , was uploaded on Videa ( a Hungarian video sharing website ) between March 13 and April 26 and was later included on the 2008 fall season DVD set . 11 further episodes were aired and a compilation of cut scenes . Though the show managed to rank #1 in 18-49 in its time slot , TV2 announced that it wont renew Beugró for a second season on May 6 . An internet petition was started to save the show , after which negotiations begun . It turned out that both Magyar Televízió ( Hungarian public service television ) and Comedy Central Hungary ( which hadnt started broadcasting by that time ) were interested in the project . Beugró continued on m1 ( in association with Comedy Central ) on Saturdays at 10 pm from September 13 . The length of the show was changed from 30 minutes to 50 minutes per episode and it became interactive ( viewers were asked to solve funny tasks , videotape it and upload on Videa ) . Also a completely new set design was introduced which was used with altering colours until it was changed again for season 7 . After Comedy Central Hungary started to broadcast ( October 1 ) it aired reruns of the show . After October 31 Beugró moved to Friday 9 pm . In December after a one-week break two more episodes aired at 9:20 pm counting altogether 14 episodes . On New Years Eve the actors performed in Millenáris , where Dorottya Udvaros stood in for Lia Pokorny during the first act . The performance was connected to a dinner . Comedy Central held two Beugró weekends when in the afternoon they broadcast five-hour-long reruns of the show on January 24–25 and March 21–22 , 2009 . Season 3 started with the New Years Eve performance at 10:40 pm on Friday , February 13 . After an Easter break the show aired at 8:20 pm until June 5 . On May 5 , the actors participated on a charity event with the actors from A Társulat ( a talent show on m1 ) . Beugró Klub ( where fans could play the games from the show ) was started in club Take5 , in Budapest . On August 1 , they had a performance in Coke Club , Siófok . The Cool TV era : 2009-2010 . The Beugró crew planned a national tour for September 2009 , but it was cancelled because of financial reasons ; and season 4 was aired on Cool TV between October 16 and December 18 at 9:15 pm with ten episodes . A board game version of the show was also published , developed by Nóra Fejtő , and followed by a refill pack ( Beugró Újratöltve ) and a second board game ( Beugró 2. ) . In November 2009 the radio version of the show was started on the newly founded Neo FM titled Beugró+ which ended in December 2010 . On December 27 , the first Beugró Live Party with Péter Kálloy Molnár and Győző Szabó was organised on Corvintető . Csaba Debreczeny , who substituted Győző Szabó in one episode in season 3 , in the New Years Eve performance ( not recorded ) on January 6–7 , 2010 and in Palace of Arts at a Magyar Telekom event on January 12 , was announced as the fifth official Beugró-actor in season 5 and onwards . By this time Beugró had more than 10,000 fans on Facebook , and also had a considerable fan community on the forum of the official site developed by Balázs Naszódi . Season 5 started on March 19 , 2010 and consisted of ten episodes like season 4 . On the next day the actors performed in Hunguest Hotel Pelion in Tapolca . Season 1 was published on DVD on March 30 . Centrál Színház held two further performances that were not recorded by Cool TV on May 10–11 .

Early political life . Spyros Markezinis was a scion of an old wealthy family of Santorini Island , who were at some time given the title marchesini ( i.e. , little Marquesses ) during Venetian rule . He earned degrees in Law and Political Science at the University of Athens , and entered private law practice . In 1936 , he was appointed counsel to King George II , a capacity in which he served until 1946 . The outbreak of World War II and Greeces occupation by Nazi Germany forced the king to flee the country , while Markezinis remained to fight as part of the resistance militias . Markezinis was elected in the Parliament ( the ) during the 1946 elections as a member of the United Nationalist Party from the Cyclades . Shortly thereafter , he left the party and founded the New Party , the second of many parties under which he would serve . The New Party won 2.5% of the vote in the 1950 parliamentary elections , enough to for a single seat ( Andreas Stratos ) in the new parliament . Economic reform . In 1949 , Markezinis was appointed Minister Without Portfolio , but was effectively assigned control over the governments economic policy , coordinating the activities of the various economic ministries . Upon the election of long-time ally Marshal Alexandros Papagos as Prime Minister in 1952 , Markeziniss effective position as minister of finance was further strengthened . In April , 1953 , Markezinis orchestrated a 50% devaluation of the drachma vis-à-vis the US dollar , concurrently curbing import restrictions . Markezinis’s effective monetary policies are credited for boosting exports and consumer demand , as well as for curtailing inflation and the balance of trade deficit . Markezinis was considered at the time as a possible successor in the party leadership and premiership in the event of Marshal Papagoss retirement . Later parliamentary positions . Papagos died in 1955 . He was succeeded by neither Markezinis ( whose relations with the Marshal had become tense ) nor by other heirs apparent ( such as Panagiotis Kanellopoulos nor Stephanos Stephanopoulos ) , but by Konstantinos Karamanlis , a junior minister who was appointed by King Paul to form a new government . Karamanlis managed to gather the support of nearly all the MPs of Marshal Papagoss party , and eventually formed the conservative National Radical Union ( ERE ) . In the same year , Markezinis founded the Progressive Party , but failed to win seats in the 1956 elections . Markezinis’s Party eventually won a seat in parliament in the 1958 elections . In 1961 , he was re-elected in coalition with the Center Union , as well as in 1964 , in coalition with the National Radical Union . Years of political turmoil ensued , and culminated in a military coup on 21 April 1967 , orchestrated by Georgios Papadopoulos , which resulted in a 7-year military regime . Premiership under the dictatorship . In 1973 , the predominantly royalist Hellenic Navy staged an abortive attempt to overthrow the military regime . Junta strongman George Papadopoulos retaliated by deposing the already self-exiled King Constantine II , and appointing himself President of the Republic further to a controversial referendum . In face of growing difficulties with the economy , popular dissent and increasing diplomatic isolation , the Greek junta was seeking ways for a transition to some form of parliamentary rule . Papadopoulos sought support from the old political establishment , and Markezinis accepted to undertake the mission to help lead the country back to parliamentary rule in a process that was called metapolitefsi . In September 1973 , he was appointed by Papadopoulos Prime Minister of Greece , with the task to lead Greece to parliamentary rule . He accepted the task , subject to a commitment by Papadopoulos to curtail any military interference . Papadopoulos proceeded to abolish martial law , and eased censorship of the press . Free elections were promised , in which political formations including part of the traditional left-of-centre were expected to participate . However , the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) , banned since the civil war , and United Democratic Left ( EDA ) , the party which mostly fronted for KKE during the years of democratic rule , were not expected to be re-legitimised nor allowed to participate . In any case , most leading politicians of the old guard , including Karamanlis , Andreas Papandreou , Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Georgios Mavros , with the exception of former MP and exile Pavlos Vardinogiannis , condemned the attempt at Metapolitefsi by Papadopoulos and Markezinis , and refused to participate in any contacts with the ruling junta , insisting on an unconditional and immediate reinstatement of democratic rule . In November 1973 , the Athens Polytechnic uprising broke out . The student uprising is generally believed to have been spontaneous , started with purely student demands at first , and not orchestrated by any political groups in Greece . ( Initially , it was condemned by the parties of the Greek Left , which had been banned by the ruling junta . There were suspicions at the time that the uprising was an act of provocation orchestrated by factions within the military regime opposed to the process of political normalization and would use the uprising to derail it. ) The student protests in front of the Polytechnic , within a few days , evolved into a clearly political , quite vocal and rather widespread , albeit peaceful , rebellion against the dictatorship . After approximately three days and nights of continuous mass gatherings in front of the Polytechnic , the protests were put down by force , through the use of tanks and army units which stormed the building during the night of November 17 . On November 25 , 1973 , Taxiarkhos Dimitrios Ioannides used the events as a pretext to stage a countercoup that overthrew Papadopoulos , and put a dramatic end to Papadopoulos and Markezinis attempt for a transition to democratic rule . Ioannidis arrested Markezinis , cancelled the elections , and fully reinstated martial law . His regime in turn crumbled in July 1974 , after the coup against Makarios III by the Greek junta of Ioannidis which led to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus . Markezinis would subsequently point out that his participation in the political normalization attempted by Papadopoulos aimed precisely at avoiding such a national catastrophe . The restoration of democracy . Markezinis was involved in the negotiations in July 1974 that led to the return of democratic government under Karamanliss national unity government . Markeziniss Progressive Party remained an active political party , albeit a small one , whose main success consisted of electing a delegate to the European parliament in 1981 . Markezinis spent his latter years writing his memoirs and on the political history of contemporary Greece . Legacy . Markezinis’s tenure as Prime Minister of Greece under the Junta remains controversial . Some praise his willingness to undertake the daunting , quixotic , and ultimately unsuccessful task of restoring parliamentary rule in a smooth and bloodless manner in 1973 . Others feel that Markezinis lost all credibility as a politician by accepting a political appointment by dictator Georgios Papadopoulos . Markezinis is , however , almost universally acclaimed for his successful economic reforms in the 1950s , and for his prolific historical publications , which include the multi-volume The Political History of Modern Greece .</p><p>question: What position did Spyros Markezinis take from Nov 1952 to Apr 1954?</p><p>pred: minister of finance</p><p>context_time: In 1949 , Markezinis was appointed Minister Without Portfolio , but was effectively assigned control over the governments economic policy , coordinating the activities of the various economic ministries .

Gasly came under increasing pressure at the Hungarian Grand Prix , after being lapped by Verstappen during a race in which he could have assisted Verstappen from being passed by Lewis Hamilton for the race win , had he been close enough behind . Despite Gaslys poor form , Red Bull team principal Christian Horner claimed that it was the teams intention to keep Gasly until the end of the season . By the summer break , Gasly was in 6th place in the championship with 63 points , just five points clear of Carlos Sainz Jr . in the inferior McLaren .

Ahead of the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix , Gasly was demoted back to junior team Toro Rosso with Alexander Albon taking his place . Upon the shock mid-season announcement , the team at Red Bull said in a press release , “The team will use the next nine races to evaluate Alex’s performance in order to make an informed decision as to who will drive alongside Max in 2020.” On the dropping of Gasly , Christian Horner said : Pierre really needs to take some time out during the break , reflect , and take the lessons into the second part of the year .

During the remainder of the season at Toro Rosso , partnering Daniil Kvyat , Gasly achieved five points finishes , including a 9th-place finish at his first race back at the team in Belgium . His best performance came at the chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix . Gasly qualified in 7th place and took advantage of retirements from Valtteri Bottas and both Ferrari drivers , as well as a collision between Lewis Hamilton and Alexander Albon , to finish the race in 2nd place after holding off Hamilton in a straight drag to the finish line . This marked the first podium finish of Gaslys Formula One career , Toro Rossos best race result since the 2008 Italian Grand Prix , and Hondas first 1–2 finish since the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix .

At the 2020 Italian Grand Prix , an early pit stop allowed Gasly to pass several drivers - who had to wait for the pitlane to be open during a safety car procedure - and go up to a net third place . As race leader Hamilton boxed to serve a stop-go penalty and second-place driver Stroll went wide at the Roggia chicane , Gasly inherited the lead of the race and managed to hold off the late-charging Carlos Sainz to take his first win in Formula One , becoming the 109th different race winner in F1 and the first French driver to win a Grand Prix since Olivier Panis victory at the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix , 24 years prior . This prompted speculation that Gasly could return to Red Bull ( as Albon , the driver who replaced him at Red Bull , only managed to finish in 15th ) , and Gasly himself said that he was ready to do so . AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost praised Gaslys race but dismissed the possibility of Gasly returning to Red Bull soon . He finished the 2020 season in 10th place with 75 points . Gasly was retained by AlphaTauri for 2021 , partnered by Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda . Racing record . Racing career summary . Season still in progress . Complete Formula One results .

Addington is best known for obtaining the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 , an unfavourable peace with Napoleonic France which marked the end of the Second Coalition during the French Revolutionary Wars . When that treaty broke down he resumed the war , but he was without allies and conducted relatively weak defensive hostilities , ahead of what would become the War of the Third Coalition . He was forced from office in favour of William Pitt the Younger , who had preceded Addington as Prime Minister . Addington is also known for his reactionary crackdown on advocates of democratic reforms during a ten-year spell as Home Secretary from 1812 to 1822 . He is the longest continuously serving holder of that office since it was created in 1782 . Family . Henry Addington was the son of Anthony Addington , Pitt the Elders physician ; and Mary Addington , the daughter of the Rev . Haviland John Hiley , headmaster of Reading School . As a consequence of his fathers position , Addington was a childhood friend of William Pitt the Younger . Addington studied at Reading School , Winchester , and Brasenose College , Oxford , and then studied law at Lincolns Inn . He married Ursula Mary Hammond in 1781 ; she brought an income of £1,000 a year into the marriage . The couple had eight children , of whom six survived to adulthood . Ursula Addington died in 1811 ; in 1823 Addington married a widow , Marianne Townsend , daughter of William Scott , 1st Baron Stowell . Political career . He was elected to the House of Commons in 1784 as one of the Members of Parliament for Devizes , and became Speaker of the House of Commons in 1789 . In March 1801 , William Pitt the Younger resigned from office , ostensibly over the refusal of King George III to remove some of the existing political restrictions on Roman Catholics in Ireland ( Catholic Emancipation ) , but poor health , failure in war , economic collapse , alarming levels of social unrest due to famine , and irreconcilable divisions within the Cabinet also played a role . Both Pitt and the King insisted that Addington take over as Prime Minister , despite his own objections , and his failed attempts to reconcile the King and Pitt . Prime Minister . Foreign policy was the centrepiece of his term in office . Some historians have been highly critical and said that it was ignorant and indifferent to Britains greatest needs . However , Thomas Goldsmith argues that Addington and Hawkesbury conducted a logical , consistent and eurocentric balance-of-power policy , rooted in rules and assumptions governing their conduct , rather than a chaotic free-for-all approach . Addingtons domestic reforms doubled the efficiency of the income tax . In foreign affairs , he secured the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 . While the treatys terms were the bare minimum that that the British government could accept , Napoleon Bonaparte would not have agreed to any terms more favourable to the British , and the British government had reached a state of financial collapse from war expenditure , the loss of Continental markets for British goods and two successive failed harvests that had led to widespread famine and social unrest , rendering peace a necessity . By early 1803 , Britains financial and diplomatic positions had recovered sufficiently to allow Addington to declare war on France , when it became clear that the French would not allow a settlement for the defences of Malta that would have been secure enough to fend off a French invasion that appeared imminent . At the time and ever since , Addington has been criticised for his lacklustre conduct of the war and his defensive posture . However , without allies , Britains options were limited to defence . He increased the forces , provided a tax base that could finance an enlarged war and seized several French possessions . To gain allies , Addington cultivated better relations with Russia , Austria , and Prussia , which later culminated in the Third Coalition shortly after he left office . Addington also strengthened British defences against a French invasion through the building of Martello towers on the south coast and the raising of more than 600,000 men at arms . Foundling Hospital . In 1802 , Addington accepted an honorary position as vice-president for life on the Court of Governors of Londons Foundling Hospital for abandoned babies . Loss of office . Although the King stood by him , it was not enough because Addington did not have a strong enough hold on both Houses of Parliament . By May 1804 , partisan criticism of Addingtons war policies provided the pretext for a parliamentary putsch by the three major factions ( Grenvillites , Foxites , and Pittites ) , who had decided that they should replace Addingtons ministry . Addingtons greatest failing was his inability to manage a parliamentary majority by cultivating the loyal support of MPs beyond his own circle and the friends of the King . That , combined with his mediocre speaking ability , left him vulnerable to Pitts mastery of parliamentary management and his unparalleled oratory skills . Pitts parliamentary assault against Addington in March 1804 led to the slimming of his parliamentary majority to the point that defeat in the House of Commons was imminent . Lord President and Lord Privy Seal . Addington remained an important political figure because he had gained a large following of MPs who supported him loyally in the Commons . He was reconciled with Pitt in December 1804 , with the help of Lord Hawkesbury as an intermediary . As a result , Pitt arranged for him to join the Cabinet as Lord President of the Council in January 1805 but insisted for Addington to accept a peerage to avoid the inconvenience of them sitting together in the Commons and Addington was created Viscount Sidmouth , of Sidmouth in the County of Devon on 12 January 1805 . In return for the support of the government by Addingtons loyal supporters , Pitt agreed to include Addingtons colleague the Earl of Buckinghamshire as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster with a promise to elevate him to the first vacancy of a more senior position in the Cabinet . However , when Melville resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty in July 1805 , Pitt broke his promise by having Sir Charles Middleton appointed instead of Buckinghamshire . As a result of the betrayal , Addington and Buckinghamshire resigned and took all of their supporters into opposition . Addington was appointed Lord Privy Seal in 1806 in the Ministry of All the Talents that succeeded Pitt . Later that year he returned to the position of Lord President to 1807 . His resignation , in opposition to a limited measure of Catholic Emancipation , which the Cabinet was considering despite the opposition of King George III , precipitated the fall of the Talents Ministry . Home Secretary . He returned to government again as Lord President in March 1812 , and , in June of the same year , became Home Secretary . As Home Secretary , Addington countered revolutionary opposition , being responsible for the temporary suspension of habeas corpus in 1817 and the passage of the Six Acts in 1819 . His tenure also saw the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 . He left office in 1822 , succeeded as Home Secretary by Sir Robert Peel , but Addington remained in the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio for the next two years , opposing , along with the Duke of Wellington , other members of Cabinet , and King George IV , British recognition of the South American republics . He remained active in the House of Lords for the next few years , making his final speech in opposition to Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and casting his final vote against the Reform Act 1832 . Residences and land . Addington maintained homes at Upottery , Devon and Bulmershe Court , in what is now the Reading suburb of Woodley , but moved to the White Lodge in Richmond Park when he became Prime Minister . However , he maintained links with Woodley and the Reading area as commander of the Woodley Yeomanry Cavalry and High Steward of Reading . He also donated to the town of Reading the four acres of land that is today the site of the Royal Berkshire Hospital , and his name is commemorated in the towns Sidmouth Street and Addington Road as well as in Sidmouth Street in Devizes . As Speaker of the House of Commons , from 1795 he had a residence in the Palace of Westminster , to the north-east of the House of Commons . Death . Addington died in London on 15 February 1844 at the age of 86 , and was buried in the churchyard at St Mary the Virgin , Mortlake , now in Greater London .

Appearance event ordination . Appearance Event Ordination ( AEO ) is a superior form of dating fossil collections , according to Alroy . Age assignments to North American land mammals are provided for comparison and may disagree with the AEO estimates because they are taken straight from published sources . Therefore , the assignments reflect the subjective opinions of the authors who described the fossils . They are not based on quantitative analyses of faunal and biostratigraphic data . AEO age estimates are preferable because they are objective , repeatable , and quantitative . Thats because AEO uses explicitly recorded and clearly defined numerical data , and because it uses algorithmic search and optimization criteria instead of verbal argumentation .</p><p>question: Who did John Alroy work for from 1989 to 1990?</p><p>pred: Smithsonian Institution</p><p>context_time: - Reed College , Department of Biology , B.A. , 1989 . - Smithsonian Institution , Predoctoral internship , Department of Paleobiology and Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems consortium , 1989–1990 .</p><p>pred_time: </p><p>groundtruth: Smithsonian Institution</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-46"/wiki/John_Alroy#P108#1</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/John_Alroy#P108#1<p>context: John Alroy John Alroy is a paleobiologist born in New York in 1966 and now residing in Sydney , Australia .

Appearance event ordination . Appearance Event Ordination ( AEO ) is a superior form of dating fossil collections , according to Alroy . Age assignments to North American land mammals are provided for comparison and may disagree with the AEO estimates because they are taken straight from published sources . Therefore , the assignments reflect the subjective opinions of the authors who described the fossils . They are not based on quantitative analyses of faunal and biostratigraphic data . AEO age estimates are preferable because they are objective , repeatable , and quantitative . Thats because AEO uses explicitly recorded and clearly defined numerical data , and because it uses algorithmic search and optimization criteria instead of verbal argumentation .</p><p>question: Which employer did John Alroy work for from 1994 to 1996?</p><p>pred: University of Arizona</p><p>context_time: - University of Chicago , Committee on Evolutionary Biology , PhD , 1994 . - University of Arizona , Research Training Group in the Analysis of Biodiversification , 1994–1996 . - Constant extinction , constrained diversification , and uncoordinated stasis in North American mammals .

He was the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Macclesfield from 1971 until he retired from the House of Commons at the 2010 general election . His wife , Ann Winterton , also served as a Member of Parliament , representing the neighbouring Congleton constituency from 1983 to 2010 . Early life . Winterton was born in Rugeley , Staffordshire and was educated at Bilton Grange , a prep school in Rugby , then Rugby School . He undertook his National Service from 1957 to 1959 and was commissioned into the 14th/20th Kings Hussars serving in Germany before leaving to work as a trainee sales executive with Shell-Mex and BP . In 1960 , he became a Sales and General Manager of a construction machinery company , a job he retained until he was elected to Parliament . He served as a member of the West Midlands Conservative Council from 1967 to 1971 and was a Warwickshire County Councillor representing a coal mining and industrial division in North Warwickshire from 1967 to 1972 . In 1969 he contested a by-election in Newcastle-under-Lyme but was unsuccessful ; he stood again for the same seat at the 1970 general election but again was unsuccessful . Member of Parliament . Winterton was elected to the House of Commons at the third attempt , winning a by-election in Macclesfield in September 1971 . He is considered a right-wing Conservative , opposing the reduction of the age of consent for same-sex sexual relations to 16 , the ban on fox hunting and supporting Section 28 and the reintroduction of capital punishment . For some years he was a member of the Conservative Monday Club and on 26 January 1981 , he was the Guest-of-Honour at the clubs Africa Group Dinner at St Stephens Club , Westminster , where Harold Soref was in the chair . He is also a signatory to The Freedom Associations Better Off Out campaign , opposing Britains membership of the European Union . He wears a small badge in the design of the pound sterling symbol to signify his opposition to any plans for the Euro being adopted as Britains national currency . In and possibly before 1988 he was with several other Members of Parliament a member of the parliamentary advisory board of the Western Goals Institute . Although never promoted to a ministerial or shadow role , he served as a member of the Social Services Select committee between 1979 and 1990 and was then chairman of the Health Select Committee ( 1990–92 ) . Winterton was a member of the Speakers Panel of Chairmen . He was also a member of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons and served as a vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee . Winterton was one of the few MPs to ask a question at Tony Blairs last Prime ministers questions : he demanded a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty . He was knighted by Elizabeth II in June 2002 for services to Parliament . The Wintertons were investigated by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner and he concluded that they misused their MPs expenses to pay rent for a flat that they had already bought outright . Once the mortgage had been fully repaid , the Wintertons transferred the ownership of the flat into a family trust . Since 2002 they had paid the rent to their trust for living in the flat from their MPs expenditure . The Committee accepted that the Wintertons had at no stage attempted to conceal their arrangements . Winterton said of his expenses : I try to tackle matters of expenses in a responsible way , I dont spend any more money than is absolutely necessary . This was at odds with his partys leader , David Cameron , who described them as indefensible . On 25 May 2009 it was announced that both the Wintertons would stand down as MPs at the next general election . Winterton was accused of slapping Labour MP Natascha Engels bottom . When asked if the accusation was true , Winterton replied : Im quite a normal person . Will I slap a colleague on the back , Will I slap a colleague in friendship ? The answer is – it is certainly possible . On 18 February 2010 during a BBC Radio 5 Live interview he defended MPs travelling first class by saying that people who travelled in standard class on trains were a totally different type of people . Commenting to a BBC reporter , a Conservative spokesman stated that these remarks ...do not in any way represent the views of [ ... ] the Conservative Party . Affiliations . Winterton has been involved in a wide range of organisations and interests . Local charities he supports include the Macclesfield Access Group , the Multiple Sclerosis Society , Riding for the Disabled , Macclesfield Handicapped Social Club and the Rossendale Trust . He is a vice president of the East Cheshire Hospice and a patron of the local branch of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . For 30 years he has been a patron of the Macclesfield &amp; District Sheep Dog Trials Association . He also helps local organisations such as Age Concern and Macmillan Cancer Care and is an honorary member of the Macclesfield &amp; District Lions Club . He is a supporter of Macclesfield Town F.C . and Macclesfield R.U.F.C . Winterton is also actively involved with local Scouting and Guiding . He is a vice president of Cheshire Scout County and Macclesfield and Congleton District Scout Council . He is an ambassador for Guiding by Girlguiding UK . In recognition of his contribution to Scouting he has been awarded the Medal of Merit for Outstanding Services to the Scout Movement . For 26 years he was on The Duke of Edinburghs Award Scheme National Advisory Committee . He is an honorary Vice-President of the Royal College of Midwives and a freeman of the City of London . He is also a Past Upper Bailiff and Member of Court of the Worshipful Company of Weavers . As a result of many years supporting St John Ambulance Winterton is a Serving Brother of the Venerable Order of Saint John . He is Patron/Chairman of the Zimbabwe-Rhodesia Relief Fund , a registered charity . Personal life . Winterton married Ann Hodgson in 1960 in Sutton Coldfield . In the 1983 general election she became the Member of Parliament for Congleton , adjacent to his Macclesfield constituency . They have two sons , Andrew and Robert , one daughter , Sarah , and eight grandchildren .

The objectives of the International Mathematical Union ( IMU ) are : promoting international cooperation in mathematics , supporting and assisting the International Congress of Mathematicians ( ICM ) and other international scientific meetings/conferences , acknowledging outstanding research contributions to mathematics through the awarding of scientific prizes , and encouraging and supporting other international mathematical activities , considered likely to contribute to the development of mathematical science in any of its aspects , whether pure , applied , or educational . The IMU was established in 1920 , but dissolved in September 1932 and then re-established 1950 de facto at the Constitutive Convention in New York , de jure on September 10 , 1951 , when ten countries had become members . The last milestone was the General Assembly in March 1952 , in Rome , Italy where the activities of the new IMU were inaugurated and the first Executive Committee , President and various commissions were elected . In 1952 the IMU was also readmitted to the ICSU . The past president of the Union is Shigefumi Mori ( 2015–2018 ) . The current president is Carlos Kenig . At the 16th meeting of the IMU General Assembly in Bangalore , India , in August 2010 , Berlin was chosen as the location of the permanent office of the IMU , which was opened on January 1 , 2011 , and is hosted by the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics ( WIAS ) , an institute of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community , with about 120 scientists engaging in mathematical research applied to complex problems in industry and commerce . Commissions and committees . IMU has a close relationship to mathematics education through its International Commission on Mathematical Instruction ( ICMI ) . This commission is organized similarly to IMU with its own Executive Committee and General Assembly . Developing countries are a high priority for the IMU and a significant percentage of its budget , including grants received from individuals , mathematical societies , foundations , and funding agencies , is spent on activities for developing countries . Since 2011 this has been coordinated by the Commission for Developing Countries ( CDC ) . The Committee for Women in Mathematics ( CWM ) is concerned with issues related to women in mathematics worldwide . It organizes the World Meeting for Women in Mathematics formula_1 as a satellite event of ICM . The International Commission on the History of Mathematics ( ICHM ) is operated jointly by the IMU and the Division of the History of Science ( DHS ) of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science ( IUHPS ) . The Committee on Electronic Information and Communication ( CEIC ) advises IMU on matters concerning mathematical information , communication , and publishing . Prizes . The scientific prizes awarded by the IMU are deemed to be the highest distinctions in the mathematical world . The opening ceremony of the International Congress of Mathematicians ( ICM ) is where the awards are presented : Fields Medals ( two to four medals are given since 1936 ) , the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize ( since 1986 ) , the Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize ( since 2006 ) , and the Chern Medal Award ( since 2010 ) . Membership and General Assembly . The IMUs members are Member Countries and each Member country is represented through an Adhering Organization , which may be its principal academy , a mathematical society , its research council or some other institution or association of institutions , or an appropriate agency of its government . A country starting to develop its mathematical culture and interested in building links to mathematicians all over the world is invited to join IMU as an Associate Member . For the purpose of facilitating jointly sponsored activities and jointly pursuing the objectives of the IMU , multinational mathematical societies and professional societies can join IMU as an Affiliate Member . Every four years the IMU membership gathers in a General Assembly ( GA ) which consists of delegates appointed by the Adhering Organizations , together with the members of the Executive Committee . All important decisions are made at the GA , including the election of the officers , establishment of commissions , the approval of the budget , and any changes to the statutes and by-laws . Organization and Executive Committee . The International Mathematical Union is administered by an Executive Committee ( EC ) which conducts the business of the Union . The EC consists of the President , two Vice-Presidents , the Secretary , six Members-at-Large , all elected for a term of four years , and the Past President . The EC is responsible for all policy matters and for tasks , such as choosing the members of the ICM Program Committee and various prize committees . Publications . Every two months IMU publishes an electronic newsletter , IMU-Net , that aims to improve communication between IMU and the worldwide mathematical community by reporting on decisions and recommendations of the Union , major international mathematical events and developments , and on other topics of general mathematical interest . IMU Bulletins are published annually with the aim to inform IMUs members about the Unions current activities . In 2009 IMU published the document Best Current Practices for Journals . IMU’s Involvement in Developing Countries . The IMU took its first organized steps towards the promotion of mathematics in developing countries in the early 1970s and has , since then supported various activities . In 2010 IMU formed the Commission for Developing Countries ( CDC ) which brings together all of the past and current initiatives in support of mathematics and mathematicians in the developing world . Some IMU Supported Initiatives : - Grants Program for Mathematicians : The Commission for Developing Countries supports research travel of mathematicians based in developing countries as well as mathematics research conferences in the developing world through its Grants Program which is open to mathematicians throughout the developing world , including countries that are not ( yet ) members of the IMU . - African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative ( AMMSI ) is a network of mathematics centers in sub-Saharan Africa that organizes conferences and workshops , visiting lectureships and an extensive scholarship program for mathematics graduate students doing PhD work on the African continent . - Mentoring African Research in Mathematics ( MARM ) : IMU supported the London Mathematical Society ( LMS ) in founding the MARM programme , which supports mathematics and its teaching in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa via a mentoring partnership between mathematicians in the United Kingdom and African colleagues , together with their students . It focuses on cultivating long-term mentoring relations between individual mathematicians and students . - Volunteer Lecturer Program ( VLP ) of IMU identifies mathematicians interested in contributing to the formation of young mathematicians in the developing world . The Volunteer Lecturer Program maintains a database of mathematic volunteers willing to offer month-long intensive courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level in degree programmes at universities in the developing world . IMU also seeks applications from universities and mathematics degree programmes in the developing world that are in need of volunteer lecturers , and that can provide the necessary conditions for productive collaboration in the teaching of advanced mathematics . IMU also supports the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction ( ICMI ) with its programmes , exhibits and workshops in emerging countries , especially in Asia and Africa . IMU released a report in 2008 , Mathematics in Africa : Challenges and Opportunities , on the current state of mathematics in Africa and on opportunities for new initiatives to support mathematical development . In 2014 , the IMUs Commission for Developing Countries CDC released an update of the report . Additionally , reports about Mathematics in Latin America and the Caribbean and South East Asia . were published . In July 2014 IMU released the report : The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World : Past , Present and Future ( July 2014 ) . MENAO Symposium at the ICM .

It is a member of the International Science Council ( ISC ) and supports the International Congress of Mathematicians . Its members are national mathematics organizations from more than 80 countries . The objectives of the International Mathematical Union ( IMU ) are : promoting international cooperation in mathematics , supporting and assisting the International Congress of Mathematicians ( ICM ) and other international scientific meetings/conferences , acknowledging outstanding research contributions to mathematics through the awarding of scientific prizes , and encouraging and supporting other international mathematical activities , considered likely to contribute to the development of mathematical science in any of its aspects , whether pure , applied , or educational . The IMU was established in 1920 , but dissolved in September 1932 and then re-established 1950 de facto at the Constitutive Convention in New York , de jure on September 10 , 1951 , when ten countries had become members . The last milestone was the General Assembly in March 1952 , in Rome , Italy where the activities of the new IMU were inaugurated and the first Executive Committee , President and various commissions were elected . In 1952 the IMU was also readmitted to the ICSU . The past president of the Union is Shigefumi Mori ( 2015–2018 ) . The current president is Carlos Kenig . At the 16th meeting of the IMU General Assembly in Bangalore , India , in August 2010 , Berlin was chosen as the location of the permanent office of the IMU , which was opened on January 1 , 2011 , and is hosted by the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics ( WIAS ) , an institute of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community , with about 120 scientists engaging in mathematical research applied to complex problems in industry and commerce . Commissions and committees . IMU has a close relationship to mathematics education through its International Commission on Mathematical Instruction ( ICMI ) . This commission is organized similarly to IMU with its own Executive Committee and General Assembly . Developing countries are a high priority for the IMU and a significant percentage of its budget , including grants received from individuals , mathematical societies , foundations , and funding agencies , is spent on activities for developing countries . Since 2011 this has been coordinated by the Commission for Developing Countries ( CDC ) . The Committee for Women in Mathematics ( CWM ) is concerned with issues related to women in mathematics worldwide . It organizes the World Meeting for Women in Mathematics formula_1 as a satellite event of ICM . The International Commission on the History of Mathematics ( ICHM ) is operated jointly by the IMU and the Division of the History of Science ( DHS ) of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science ( IUHPS ) . The Committee on Electronic Information and Communication ( CEIC ) advises IMU on matters concerning mathematical information , communication , and publishing . Prizes . The scientific prizes awarded by the IMU are deemed to be the highest distinctions in the mathematical world . The opening ceremony of the International Congress of Mathematicians ( ICM ) is where the awards are presented : Fields Medals ( two to four medals are given since 1936 ) , the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize ( since 1986 ) , the Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize ( since 2006 ) , and the Chern Medal Award ( since 2010 ) . Membership and General Assembly . The IMUs members are Member Countries and each Member country is represented through an Adhering Organization , which may be its principal academy , a mathematical society , its research council or some other institution or association of institutions , or an appropriate agency of its government . A country starting to develop its mathematical culture and interested in building links to mathematicians all over the world is invited to join IMU as an Associate Member . For the purpose of facilitating jointly sponsored activities and jointly pursuing the objectives of the IMU , multinational mathematical societies and professional societies can join IMU as an Affiliate Member . Every four years the IMU membership gathers in a General Assembly ( GA ) which consists of delegates appointed by the Adhering Organizations , together with the members of the Executive Committee . All important decisions are made at the GA , including the election of the officers , establishment of commissions , the approval of the budget , and any changes to the statutes and by-laws . Organization and Executive Committee . The International Mathematical Union is administered by an Executive Committee ( EC ) which conducts the business of the Union . The EC consists of the President , two Vice-Presidents , the Secretary , six Members-at-Large , all elected for a term of four years , and the Past President . The EC is responsible for all policy matters and for tasks , such as choosing the members of the ICM Program Committee and various prize committees . Publications . Every two months IMU publishes an electronic newsletter , IMU-Net , that aims to improve communication between IMU and the worldwide mathematical community by reporting on decisions and recommendations of the Union , major international mathematical events and developments , and on other topics of general mathematical interest . IMU Bulletins are published annually with the aim to inform IMUs members about the Unions current activities . In 2009 IMU published the document Best Current Practices for Journals . IMU’s Involvement in Developing Countries . The IMU took its first organized steps towards the promotion of mathematics in developing countries in the early 1970s and has , since then supported various activities . In 2010 IMU formed the Commission for Developing Countries ( CDC ) which brings together all of the past and current initiatives in support of mathematics and mathematicians in the developing world . Some IMU Supported Initiatives : - Grants Program for Mathematicians : The Commission for Developing Countries supports research travel of mathematicians based in developing countries as well as mathematics research conferences in the developing world through its Grants Program which is open to mathematicians throughout the developing world , including countries that are not ( yet ) members of the IMU . - African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative ( AMMSI ) is a network of mathematics centers in sub-Saharan Africa that organizes conferences and workshops , visiting lectureships and an extensive scholarship program for mathematics graduate students doing PhD work on the African continent . - Mentoring African Research in Mathematics ( MARM ) : IMU supported the London Mathematical Society ( LMS ) in founding the MARM programme , which supports mathematics and its teaching in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa via a mentoring partnership between mathematicians in the United Kingdom and African colleagues , together with their students . It focuses on cultivating long-term mentoring relations between individual mathematicians and students . - Volunteer Lecturer Program ( VLP ) of IMU identifies mathematicians interested in contributing to the formation of young mathematicians in the developing world . The Volunteer Lecturer Program maintains a database of mathematic volunteers willing to offer month-long intensive courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level in degree programmes at universities in the developing world . IMU also seeks applications from universities and mathematics degree programmes in the developing world that are in need of volunteer lecturers , and that can provide the necessary conditions for productive collaboration in the teaching of advanced mathematics . IMU also supports the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction ( ICMI ) with its programmes , exhibits and workshops in emerging countries , especially in Asia and Africa . IMU released a report in 2008 , Mathematics in Africa : Challenges and Opportunities , on the current state of mathematics in Africa and on opportunities for new initiatives to support mathematical development . In 2014 , the IMUs Commission for Developing Countries CDC released an update of the report . Additionally , reports about Mathematics in Latin America and the Caribbean and South East Asia . were published . In July 2014 IMU released the report : The International Mathematical Union in the Developing World : Past , Present and Future ( July 2014 ) . MENAO Symposium at the ICM . In 2014 , the IMU held a day-long symposium prior to the opening of the International Congress of Mathematicians ( ICM ) , entitled Mathematics in Emerging Nations : Achievements and Opportunities ( MENAO ) . Approximately 260 participants from around the world , including representatives of embassies , scientific institutions , private business and foundations attended this session . Attendees heard inspiring stories of individual mathematicians and specific developing nations .

Its 535,061 ( 2017 ) inhabitants make it the 13th-largest city in Germany as well as the third-largest city in Northern Germany after Hamburg and Bremen . Hanovers urban area comprises the towns of Garbsen , Langenhagen and Laatzen and has a population of about 791,000 ( 2018 ) . The Hanover Region has approximately 1.16 million inhabitants ( 2019 ) . The city lies at the confluence of the River Leine ( progression : ) and its tributary Ihme , in the south of the North German Plain , and is the largest city in the Hannover–Braunschweig–Göttingen–Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region . It is the fifth-largest city in the Low German dialect area after Hamburg , Dortmund , Essen and Bremen . Before it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946 , Hanover was the capital of the Principality of Calenberg ( 1636–1692 ) , the Electorate of Hanover ( 1692–1814 ) , the Kingdom of Hanover ( 1814–1866 ) , the Province of Hanover of the Kingdom of Prussia ( 1868–1918 ) , the Province of Hanover of the Free State of Prussia ( 1918–1946 ) and of the State of Hanover ( 1946 ) . From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( later described as the Elector of Hanover ) . The city is a major crossing point of railway lines and motorways ( Autobahnen ) , connecting European main lines in both the east-west ( Berlin–Ruhr area/Düsseldorf/Cologne ) and north-south ( Hamburg–Frankfurt/Stuttgart/Munich ) directions . Hannover Airport lies north of the city , in Langenhagen , and is Germanys ninth-busiest airport . The citys most notable institutes of higher education are the Hannover Medical School ( Medizinische Hochschule Hannover ) , one of Germanys leading medical schools , with its university hospital Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover , and the Leibniz University Hannover . The Hanover fairground , owing to numerous extensions , especially for the Expo 2000 , is the largest in the world . Hanover hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and up to 2018 the CeBIT . The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years . It is the worlds leading trade show for transport , logistics and mobility . Every year Hanover hosts the Schützenfest Hannover , the worlds largest marksmens festival , and the Oktoberfest Hannover . Hanover is the traditional English spelling . The German spelling ( with a double n ) is becoming more popular in English ; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling , and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites . The English pronunciation , with stress on the first syllable , is applied to both the German and English spellings , which is different from German pronunciation , with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel . The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts , especially when referring to the British House of Hanover . History . Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine . Its original name Honovere may mean high ( river ) bank , though this is debated ( cf . das Hohe Ufer ) . Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century , receiving town privileges in 1241 , owing to its position at a natural crossroads . As overland travel was relatively difficult its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade . It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains , so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it . Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine , Ruhr and Saar river valleys , their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north , for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia . In the 14th century the main churches of Hanover were built , as well as a city wall with three city gates . The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern Harz Mountains , which increased the citys importance . In 1636 George , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , ruler of the Brunswick-Lüneburg principality of Calenberg , moved his residence to Hanover . The Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg were elevated by the Holy Roman Emperor to the rank of Prince-Elector in 1692 and this elevation was confirmed by the Imperial Diet in 1708 . Thus the principality was upgraded to the Electorate of Hanover , colloquially known as the Electorate of Hanover after Calenbergs capital ( see also : House of Hanover ) . Its Electors later become monarchs of Great Britain ( and from 1801 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ) . The first of these was George I Louis , who acceded to the British throne in 1714 . The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was William IV . Semi-Salic law , which required succession by the male line if possible , forbade the accession of Queen Victoria in Hanover . As a male-line descendant of George I , Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover . Her descendants , however , bore her husbands titular name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha . Three kings of Great Britain , or the United Kingdom , were concurrently also Electoral Princes of Hanover . During the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover ( 1714–1837 ) the monarchs rarely visited the city . In fact during the reigns of the final three joint rulers ( 1760–1837 ) there was only one short visit , by George IV in 1821 . From 1816 to 1837 Viceroy Adolphus represented the monarch in Hanover . During the Seven Years War the Battle of Hastenbeck was fought near the city on 26 July 1757 . The French army defeated the Hanoverian Army of Observation , leading to the citys occupation as part of the Invasion of Hanover . It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by Ferdinand of Brunswick the following year . 19th century . After Napoleon imposed the Convention of Artlenburg ( Convention of the Elbe ) on July 5 , 1803 , about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover . The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover . However , George III did not recognise the Convention of the Elbe . This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to Great Britain , where the Kings German Legion was formed . It was only troops from Hanover and Brunswick that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars . The Legion later played an important role in the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 . The Congress of Vienna in 1815 elevated the electorate to the Kingdom of Hanover . The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the Leine and since then has grown considerably . In 1837 , the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IVs heir in the United Kingdom was female ( Queen Victoria ) . Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs . Thus , Hanover passed to William IVs brother , Ernest Augustus , and remained a kingdom until 1866 , when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war . Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza , Prussia employed Moltke the Elders Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army . The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover . After the annexation , the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government . To Hanovers industry , however , the new connection with Prussia meant an improvement in business . The introduction of free trade promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the Gründerzeit ( the founders era ) . Between 1879 and 1902 Hanovers population grew from 87,600 to 313,940 .

After 1937 the lord mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the NSDAP ( Nazi party ) . A large Jewish population then existed in Hanover . In October 1938 , 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to Poland , including the Grynszpan family . However , Poland refused to accept them , leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees , fed only intermittently by the Polish Red Cross and Jewish welfare organisations . The Grynszpans son Herschel Grynszpan was in Paris at the time . When he learned of what was happening , he drove to the German embassy in Paris and shot the German diplomat Eduard Ernst vom Rath , who died shortly afterwards . The Nazis took this act as a pretext to stage a nationwide pogrom known as Kristallnacht ( 9 November 1938 ) . On that day , the synagogue of Hanover , designed in 1870 by Edwin Oppler in neo-romantic style , was burnt by the Nazis . In September 1941 , through the Action Lauterbacher plan , a ghettoisation of the remaining Hanoverian Jewish families began . Even before the Wannsee Conference , on 15 December 1941 , the first Jews from Hanover were deported to Riga . A total of 2,400 people were deported , and very few survived . During the war seven concentration camps were constructed in Hanover , in which many Jews were confined . Of the approximately 4,800 Jews who had lived in Hannover in 1938 , fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the United States Army arrived on 10 April 1945 to occupy Hanover at the end of the war . Today , a memorial at the Opera Square is a reminder of the persecution of the Jews in Hanover .

Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen ( Badenstedt ) . Residential areas were also targeted , and more than 6,000 civilians were killed by the Allied bombing raids . More than 90% of the city centre was destroyed in a total of 88 bombing raids . After the war , the Aegidienkirche was not rebuilt and its ruins were left as a war memorial . The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Hanover in April 1945 . The US 84th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945 .

From 1714 to 1837 Hanover was by personal union the family seat of the Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , under their title of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( later described as the Elector of Hanover ) . In 1837 , the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IVs heir in the United Kingdom was female ( Queen Victoria ) . Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs . Thus , Hanover passed to William IVs brother , Ernest Augustus , and remained a kingdom until 1866 , when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war . Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza , Prussia employed Moltke the Elders Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army . The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover . After the annexation , the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government . Hanover was in the British zone of occupation of Germany and became part of the new state ( Land ) of Lower Saxony in 1946 . - Dirk Rossmann ( born 1946 ) , businessman</p><p>pred_time: Prussian Province of Hanover</p><p>groundtruth: </p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-54"/wiki/Frédéric_Piquionne#P54#2</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Frédéric_Piquionne#P54#2<p>context: Frédéric Piquionne Frédéric Michel Piquionne ( born 8 December 1978 ) is a French former professional footballer who played as a forward .

He also played once for France in a friendly against Austria in 2007 . Early life . Piquionne was born in Nouméa , New Caledonia . Club career . Early career . In 1995 at age 17 , Piquionne played in the youth teams of Paris FC at Charenton . Not really convincing , he left the city to settle in Martinique , in Fort-de-France . There , he played football in the Division dHonneur for amateur club Golden Star and then joined JS Morne Blanc . For three years he worked as a shoe salesman in a store located in downtown Fort-de-France . However , his impressive performances encouraged his coach Jules Eustache ( a former intern at the National Institute of Football and professional footballer ) to direct him towards Nîmes . The club recruited him during the summer of 2000 and offered him his first professional contract . During the following summer and after an excellent season in Ligue 2 with Nîmes , he caught the eye of Ligue 1s Rennes . The first time he played in the French first division was 28 July 2001 against Auxerre ( 0–5 ) . In his first season in the first division , Piquionne scored 3 goals in 20 matches . In his second season , 2002–03 , he scored ten goals under the coaching of Vahid Halilhodžić .

The 2005–06 season was much more difficult . Piquionne remained as an undisputed starter but his performance in front of goal was lacking . He scored only 6 goals in 34 games and the club finished in the lower half of the table . After this second season , he had a more productive 2006–07 season , scoring six goals and six assists in the first half of the season . He also received two more red cards and missed a total of four games in 19 days . He partnered the Brazilian Ilan up front . Piquionne was under contract with Saint-Étienne until June 2009 . However , following his excellent performance , many European clubs were on alert , including Lyon , who allegedly promised to triple his salary at that time . An offer of €5.5 million by the club Lyon bid to sign him was considered ridiculous by Bernard Caiazzo . Caiazzo refused to let the player depart to a local rival . Piquionne then declared that he was being treated like a slave by Caiazzo . Eventually , Lyon signed Milan Baroš instead , but after all that was said , Piquionne said that he was ready to retire if the club refused to transfer him . His time at Saint-Étienne ended with an altercation with a supporter who criticised him for attending a Lyon match . Piquionne assaulted him , leaving him with a broken nose . Piquionne was sentenced to a €1,500 and also ordered to pay the same to the victim . Despite being disliked by fans , coach Ivan Hašek admitted that his team missed the striker . Monaco and Lyon .

He scored his first Premier League goal four days later in another 4–0 win , this time at home to Wigan Athletic . Piquionne scored 11 goals in all competitions during his stint at Portsmouth , including scoring two goals against Birmingham City in the FA Cup to ensure Portsmouth progressed to the FA Cup semi-finals . On 11 April 2010 , Piquionne scored the first goal in a 2–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur to send Portsmouth into the FA Cup final for the second time in three seasons . His goalscoring form at Portsmouth led Piquionne to feel as though he had finally found his feet in English football despite enduring a patchy start to his Premier League career . West Ham United .

In 1955 he became Regius Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow , in 1957 he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at Imperial College . In 1950 , Barton showed that organic molecules could be assigned a preferred conformation based upon results accumulated by chemical physicists , in particular by Odd Hassel . Using this new technique of conformational analysis , he later determined the geometry of many other natural product molecules . In 1969 , Barton shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Odd Hassel for contributions to the development of the concept of conformation and its application in chemistry . In 1958 Barton was appointed Arthur D . Little Visiting Professor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and in 1959 Karl Folkers Visiting Professor of at the Universities of Illinois and Wisconsin .

He moved to the United States in 1986 ( specifically Texas ) and became distinguished professor at Texas A&amp;M University and held this position for 12 years until his death . In 1996 , Barton published a comprehensive volume of his works , entitled Reason and Imagination : Reflections on Research in Organic Chemistry . As well as for his work on conformation , his name is remembered in a number of reactions in organic chemistry such as the Barton reaction , the Barton decarboxylation , and the Barton-McCombie deoxygenation . The newly built Barton Science Centre at Tonbridge School in Kent , where he was educated for 4 years , completed in 2019 , is named after him . Honours and awards .

As the Boards first chairperson , she mobilized a large number of voluntary organizations to carry out its programs , which were aimed at education , training , and rehabilitation of needy women , children , and the handicapped . She was the first to emphasise the need to set up separate Family Courts after studying the same during her visit to China in 1953 . She discussed the idea with Justice M.C . Chagla and Justice P.B . Gajendragadkar of the Bombay High Court ( at that time ) and also with Jawaharlal Nehru .

The Centre and State Governments should give priority to the education of girls . 2 . In the central ministry of education , a department of womens education should be created . 3 . For proper education of girls , a Director of Womens Education should be appointed in each state . 4 . Co-education should be properly organised at higher level of education . 5 .

ISSN 0031-4587 online - Abstract : While their different public personas , political interests , and institutional duties led to occasional disagreement , President Richard Nixon and Senate Minority Leader Scott were not always unhappily tethered as evidenced by their stances on domestic and foreign issues throughout Nixons presidency , during 1968–74 . While he jousted with Nixon over racial policies and his Supreme Court nominations , including his choice of Judge Clement F . Haynsworth , Jr. , of South Carolina , Scott supported much of Nixons domestic agenda , applauded the presidents conduct of foreign affairs , backed his Vietnam policy , praised his invasion of Cambodia , publicly proclaimed Nixons innocence during the Watergate scandal , and endorsed President Gerald Fords pardon of his predecessor . The Nixon-Scott relationship is notable because it confirms scholars assumptions about Nixons hot-and-cold association with Congress and indicates that sparring between moderate Republicans like Nixon and Scott was on its way out .

He then spent 1961 to 1963 at Stoke City , helping them to the Second Division title in 1962–63 , also spending a brief time on loan with Canadian club Toronto City . After signing with Port Vale in 1963 , he spent 1965 to 1967 as the clubs joint-manager , along with his long-time friend and teammate Stanley Matthews . He became a coach after he finished his career with Oswestry Town in 1967 , though he later managed Northwich Victoria in 1973 and then American side Cleveland Cobras for a spell in 1978 . Biography . Early years . Born in Dundee , Jackie Mudie started his footballing career with local junior sides Lochee Harp and Stobswell Juniors . Blackpool . Mudie joined Blackpool in September 1946 , signing professional terms in May 1947 . He was at the club throughout the 1950s , which are the most successful decade in the clubs history . After three years developing in the reserves , he made his debut on 8 March 1950 , against Liverpool , scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win at Anfield . The following season he featured regularly as Blackpool challenged in the league and reached the 1951 FA Cup Final . Newcastle United proved too strong at Wembley , however , and two goals from Jackie Milburn took the trophy to the North-East . After the loss , Blackpool signed Ernie Taylor , and Mudie lost his place . Eventually , though , he worked his way back into the team . In 1952–53 , Blackpool bounced back from their disappointment in 1951s FA Cup Final when Mudies last-minute goal against Tottenham Hotspur in that seasons semi-final sealed a return to Wembley , this time to face Bolton Wanderers . This match is widely remembered as the Matthews Final , due to the winger helping to turn a 3–1 deficit into a 4–3 win for Blackpool . Although Matthews and hat-trick scorer Stan Mortensen understandably took the limelight , Matthews himself would later acknowledge the importance of the selfless Mudie , noting that his skill and work for others often made some of us look better than we really were . In his early career , Mudie was considered an inside forward , however , when Mortensen was transferred to Hull City in August 1955 , Mudie became Blackpools regular centre-forward , despite his diminutive stature . This change of position , combined his scoring 22 and 38 goals in consecutive seasons , enabled him to achieve international recognition and he made his international debut against Wales in 1956 . His hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Spain in 1957 helped Scotland qualify for the following years World Cup and he was subsequently selected in the squad that travelled to Sweden . Scotland exited after the group stage , effectively ending Mudies international career with 17 caps and nine goals to his name . Stoke City . Stoke City signed Mudie , in March 1961 for £8,500 , and he scored just five minutes into his debut against Scunthorpe United . He ended the 1960–61 season with three goals from 13 matches as Stoke flirted precariously with relegation . In the summer of 1961 Mudie spent the summer months playing for Canadian side Toronto City along with Stanley Matthews , Danny Blanchflower and Johnny Haynes . After a poor start to the 1961–62 campaign , Stokes attendances at the Victoria Ground dropped alarmingly below the 10,000 mark . To address the situation manager Tony Waddington brought back Stanley Matthews to the club and it had the desired effect with 35,974 attending the next match against Huddersfield Town . Matthewss return also rekindled his partnership with Mudie which proved vital to winning the Second Division title in 1962–63 as Mudie scored 20 goals , including the opening goal in title decider against Luton Town . Port Vale . Mudie moved to Stokes local rivals Port Vale in November 1963 along with Ron Wilson in a package deal of between £12,000 and £15,000 . Initially a regular , the ageing Mudie could not play on hard surfaces due to the risk of muscle jarring , he then lost his first team place on any surface in August 1964 . After Freddie Steeles departure , Mudie became player-manager in February 1965 , combining for a third time with boyhood Vale supporter Matthews , who became the Valiants general-manager a few months later after playing his final First Division match for Stoke against Fulham five days after his 50th birthday . We can fight our way out of this crisis , Mudie said at the time . We must do . Although we are down at the bottom of the table , we are not out . His strategy was to spend money to bring in players from the North East , though this would ultimately prove to be an unsuccessful strategy . He resigned in May 1967 , citing personal reasons . Later years . After his playing retirement , Mudie continued to live in Stoke-on-Trent , his adopted hometown , setting up a painting and decorating business . He had brief spells coaching at Oswestry Town , Crewe Alexandra ( where he was assistant manager ) , Northwich Victoria , Leek Town and Eastwood Town and also spent one summer in America , as coach of the Cleveland Cobras in 1978 . He also spent time in South Africa , as a scout for Johannesburg Rangers . He later set up a painting and decorating business . Mudie died in Stoke in 1992 , aged 61 , two years after being diagnosed with cancer . Under Valiant 2001 , his son , Graham , continued the Port Vale connection by working as a director of the club .

House of Representatives and U.S . Senate , Territorial Governor of Wisconsin and a veteran of the Black Hawk War . His son was Augustus C . Dodge with whom he served in the U.S . Senate , the first , and so far only , father-son pair to serve concurrently . Henry Dodge was the half brother of Lewis F . Linn . James Clarke , the Governor of Iowa Territory was his son-in-law . Early life . Henry Dodge was the son of Israel Dodge and Nancy Hunter Dodge . Israel was from Connecticut and a veteran of the Battle of Brandywine , who came west to serve under his brother in the military command of George Rogers Clark . Nancys family similarly moved west and settled in Kentucky , and for a period of time the Hunter family was part of the settler colony whose population was recruited to support the garrison at the confluence of the Ohio River and the Mississippi River , known as Fort Jefferson . Henry Dodge was born in Vincennes ( then under the jurisdiction of Virginia ) when Nancy stopped over to visit Israel ( on duty in Vincennes ) on her way from Kaskaskia to Louisville . Henry was the first child in what is now Indiana who was born to parents from the colonies , the other residents of Vincennes being of Indian and French Canadian heritage . Dodge was raised in Kentucky . In 1788 Israel abandoned the family and Henry was raised by his mother . ( Nancy later remarried , and had a son Lewis who himself became an elected official. ) At age 14 Dodge moved to Missouri to live with his father , who ran salt and lead operations . Although Henry returned to Kentucky occasionally ( including to read law ) , his move to Missouri was permanent . In 1800 , he married Christiana McDonald . In 1805 Dodge was appointed deputy sheriff , reporting to his father . In 1806 Dodge was recruited by Aaron Burr to participate in Burrs spurious attempt at creating a new country in the southwest , an incident known as the Burr conspiracy . Dodge and a companion went so far as to report to a concentration point for the affair in New Madrid . However , when they learned that Thomas Jefferson had deemed it a treasonous act , they immediately abandoned the effort and returned home . Dodge was indicted as a participant in the conspiracy , but the charges were dropped . In 1806 Dodge was named lieutenant of the militia . In 1813 he was appointed U.S . Marshal , as well as Sheriff of Ste . Genevieve County . Career . War of 1812 . In the War of 1812 , Dodge entered as a captain in the Missouri State Volunteers . He was part of a mounted company . He finished the war as a major general of the Missouri Militia . His crowning achievement was saving about 150 Miami Indians from certain massacre after their raid on the Boones Lick settlement in the summer of 1814 . Dodge emigrated with his large family and slaves inherited from his father to the U.S . Mineral District in early July 1827 . He served as a commander of militia during the Red Bird uprising of that year , and in October settled a large tract in present-day downtown Dodgeville , known then as Dodges Camp . He worked a large claim until around 1830 , when he moved several miles south in a beautiful forested area known still as Dodges Grove . Here he began building what would become a large two-story frame house for his ever-growing extended family . It is worthy to note that , despite the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 banning slavery in the entire Northwest Territory , including Wisconsin , Dodge brought five black slaves from Missouri to work in his lead mines . Black Hawk War . Dodge rose to prominence during the Black Hawk War of 1832 . As colonel of the western Michigan Territory Militia , Dodge brought a credible fighting force into being in a very short time . More than fifteen forts , fortified homes and blockhouses sprang up almost overnight . From these forts , Dodge and the mounted volunteers , with four companies of Territorial militia and one of Illinois mounted rangers , took to the field as the Michigan Mounted Volunteers . Dodge and his men saw action at the battles of Horseshoe Bend , Wisconsin Heights , and Bad Axe . In June 1832 , he accepted a commission as Major of the Battalion of Mounted Rangers , commissioned by an Act of Congress . Apparently , he took no prisoners . None of the 12 or 13 shot at Horseshoe Bend survived . The ranger experiment lasted a year , and then , in 1833 , was replaced by the United States Regiment of Dragoons . Dodge served as colonel ; one of his captains was Nathan Boone , Daniel Boones youngest son . The United States Regiment of Dragoons was the forth mounted Regular Army unit in United States Army history , not including the American Revolution , Continental Light Dragoons . In the summer of 1834 , Colonel Dodge engaged on First Dragoon Expedition and made successful contact with the Comanches . He was an Indian fighter , most noted for his 1835 peace mission commissioned by President Andrew Jackson , who had called out the U.S . Dragoons to assist . Territorial governor . Dodge was the first Territorial governor of Wisconsin Territory from 1836 to 1841 and again from 1845 to 1848 , an area which encompassed ( before July 4 , 1838 , when Iowa became a territory ) what became the states of Wisconsin , Iowa and Minnesota . In between his two terms as governor , Dodge was elected as a non-voting Democratic delegate to the Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Congresses ( March 4 , 1841 – March 3 , 1845 ) representing Wisconsin Territorys at-large congressional district . He declined the opportunity to have his name put forward for the Presidency of the United States at the 1844 Democratic National Convention . He was loyal to Martin Van Buren and both men opposed the annexation of Texas . Despite their efforts , James K . Polk , the Democrat who favored annexation , became President . Upon Wisconsin being admitted to the Union , Dodge was elected one of its first two senators . He served two terms . He turned down the appointment of Territorial Governor of Washington from Franklin Pierce in 1857 . Death . Dodge died in 1867 in Burlington , Iowa . He is interred at the Aspen Grove Cemetery in Burlington . Legacy . In 1948 , Iowa County presented a 160-acre estate to the State of Wisconsin which eventually became Governor Dodge State Park . Over the years , this park has grown to include 5,270 acres in the area Dodge once called his home . Dodge County , Wisconsin , Dodge County , Minnesota , and Henry County , Iowa , and Dodgeville , Wisconsin were named after Dodge . Fort Clark , the U.S . Army post built near the present-day location of Fort Dodge , Iowa , was renamed for Senator Dodge around 1850 . His former cabin in Dodgeville , now known as the Dodge Mining Camp Cabin , serves as a museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . References .

Perceived as a leftist-nationalist at the onset of his career in public service , Ople was , in his final years , a vocal supporter for allowing a limited United States military presence in the Philippines , and for American initiatives in the War on Terror including the 2003 U.S . invasion of Iraq . Oples most enduring role was his nineteen years as Secretary ( later Minister ) of Labor and Employment during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , when Philippine labor laws were overhauled through the enactment of the Labor Code of the Philippines that he had helped author . Early life and career . Ople was born in Hagonoy , Bulacan on February 3 , 1927 to Felix Antonio Ople , a craftsman who repaired boats , and his wife Segundina Fajardo . He graduated valedictorian of his grade school class at the Hagonoy Elementary School in 1941 . Upon the invasion of the Philippines by Japan during World War II , he also had been to Hagonoy Institute during his secondary schooling , the teenage Ople joined the guerilla movement and fought under the Del Pilar Regiment and the Buenavista Regiment of the Bulacan Military Area founded by Alejo Santos . In 1948 , he finished his high school studies at the Far Eastern University High School in Manila . He worked towards a degree in liberal arts at the Educational Center of Asia ( formerly Quezon College ) in Manila . After graduation , Ople pursued a career in journalism . He became a desk editor at the Daily Mirror and the author of its Jeepney Tales column . Still in his twenties , Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists of that era . Ople also established a public relations consulting firm . He soon became known for his nationalist views . He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa ( National Progress Movement ) , an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s . In 1953 , he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement , a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay , heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party . After Magsaysays election , he joined the government as special assistant to the Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs . Secretary of Labor . In 1965 , Ople was appointed as Social Security Commissioner by President Ferdinand E . Marcos . In 1967 , he was appointed Secretary of Labor and Employment ( in 1978 the position was renamed Minister of Labor and Employment ) . He resigned briefly in 1971 to run an unsuccessful campaign for election to the Philippine Senate , but was re-appointed to his post in 1972 , retaining the position until 1986 . At the time of his appointment , Ople was perceived as a leftist Nationalist . His leftist credentials were enhanced when he co-founded , in 1972 , the Philippine-Soviet Friendship Society . As Labor Secretary Ople was instrumental in the framing of the Labor Code of the Philippines , which codified the labor laws of the country and introduced innovations such as prohibiting the termination of workers without legal cause . Ople instituted labor policies institutionalizing the technical education of workers . In 1976 , Ople initiated a program for the overseas employment of Filipino workers . It was during his tenure at Labor that the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration were created . Ople obtained recognition from the International Labour Organization during his stint as Labor Minister . In 1975 , he was elected president of the 60th International Labour Conference of the ILO , the first Filipino to hold that post . In 1983 , that organization awarded Ople a Gold Medal of Appreciation . He was a close adviser of President Marcos , though he was not later to be associated with the corruption of the Marcos government and was perceived as not corrupt . He created international headlines in December 1984 when he admitted to the press that the lupus-stricken Marcos was incapacitated to the point of being unable to take major initiatives , and that the Presidents illness had placed the Philippines in a kind of interregnum . Marcos responded a few days later by baring his chest to his Cabinet before television cameras to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill or had undergone surgery . In 1978 , Ople was elected an Assemblyman of the Interim Batasang Pambansa representing Central Luzon , and reelected in 1984 . During the 1986 presidential elections , Ople served as a political campaign manager of President Marcos , who was running against Corazon Aquino . Shortly before the outbreak of the 1986 People Power Revolution , Marcos dispatched Ople to Washington , D.C . to lobby the American government on behalf of the President . Ople was in Washington D.C . upon the outbreak of the revolt , and was advised by U.S . Secretary of State , George P . Shultz , to call on Marcos to resign . Ople publicly reiterated his support for Marcos in the American media in such fora as on This Week with David Brinkley . 1986 Constitutional Commission Member . Following the success of the People Power Revolution and the installation to the presidency of Corazon Aquino , Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post . Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself as the leader of the political opposition against Aquino . Nonetheless in May 1986 , Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution . In the 1987 congressional elections , Ople ran a second time for the Philippine Senate , under the banner of the nationalist-led Grand Alliance for Democracy coalition . He was defeated in this attempt , and returned to private life , serving as chairman of the Institute for Public Policy ( IPP ) , a policy research institute . Senator of the Philippines . In 1992 , he ran again for the Senate under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino . He was elected to a six-year term . In the Senate , Ople served as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Commission of Appointments . He became Senate President Pro-Tempore in 1998 . Ople won a re-election for the senate in 1998 , under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino . In 1999 , upon the resignation of the terminally-ill Marcelo Fernan , Ople became the President of the Senate . In that capacity , he was a key proponent of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and the United States , which allowed American forces to enter the Philippines for short-term training exercises . He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to Franklin Drilon . Later that year , he sat as one of the senator-judges in the impeachment trial of his ally , President Joseph Estrada . He was one of the eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada . Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001 , leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency . Secretary of Foreign Affairs . In July 2002 , President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Ople , a member of the political opposition in the Senate , as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in her cabinet . The appointment was with some controversy . Weeks earlier , Arroyos hand-picked Vice-President Teofisto Guingona had resigned as Foreign Affairs Secretary after voicing disagreement with the plan of the Philippine and United States governments to allow American troops to help combat Islamic terrorist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf as part of the post-9/11 War on Terror . Ople , who had earlier been a vocal supporter of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement , was perceived to be more amenable to the plan . In addition , left-wing labor activists denounced the appointment of Ople , citing his Marcos-era role in promoting overseas employment of Filipino workers which , they said , had resulted in abuses inflicted on Filipino workers abroad . During his stint as Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Ople was at the forefront of the negotiations that led to the deployment of American military forces inside the Philippines , though he insisted that the American troops would not participate in combat missions . Under his watch , the American and Filipino governments signed an agreement that provided immunity to each others citizens facing charges before international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court . Ople was also a vocal supporter of the Iraq War , and pushed for the deployment of a small Filipino contingent in Iraq . He predicted in November 2003 , Baghdad will be transformed from a symbol of brutal despotism to a new , shining symbol of human freedom . The sacrifices invested in the liberation of Iraq , to which Filipinos made a significant contribution , will be fully vindicated and cherished for all time . Death . In the months prior to his death , Ople , a longtime chain smoker , had suffered from ill health and often attended international conferences in a wheelchair . On the night of October 13 , 2003 , Ople had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness while aboard a Japan Asia Airways flight from Bangkok to Tokyo . The flight was diverted to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan County , Taiwan ( now Taoyuan City ) , and Ople was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was initially pronounced dead on arrival , but given medical treatment nonetheless . Efforts to revive him were futile , and his death on Tuesday , October 14 , 2003 was announced by his family . President Arroyo mourned Ople as an architect of Philippine foreign policy in the finest tradition of enlightened and pragmatic diplomacy , while U.S . Secretary of State Colin Powell hailed him as one of the pivotal figures of the late Twentieth Century for Philippine history . More critical of Ople , Teddy Casiño , secretary-general of the leftist coalition BAYAN , called him a political chameleon who tried to pass himself off as a nationalist but [ was ] most pro-American . Nonetheless , Casiño acknowledged that Ople was a consistent , brilliant and very astute politician . Ople was eulogized in Time Magazine , which recalled his erudition , his skill at political survival , and his trademark extraordinary baritone . The eulogy also said that at the height of the People Power Revolution , Ople in Washington , D.C . had reported to Marcos in Manila that the Presidents support within the Reagan administration was falling . Marcos responded by asking Ople to reach out to his contacts in the Soviet government . Ople rebuffed Marcos , and as Time noted , declined to help make the Philippines a Soviet colony three years before the Berlin Wall fell . Ople is buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani . In 2004 , President Arroyo named Oples daughter , Susan Ople , as Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment .

In 1948 , he finished his high school studies at the Far Eastern University High School in Manila . He worked towards a degree in liberal arts at the Educational Center of Asia ( formerly Quezon College ) in Manila . After graduation , Ople pursued a career in journalism . He became a desk editor at the Daily Mirror and the author of its Jeepney Tales column . Still in his twenties , Ople was one of the youngest newspaper columnists of that era . Ople also established a public relations consulting firm . He soon became known for his nationalist views . He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa ( National Progress Movement ) , an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of nationalism and social justice in the 1950s . In 1953 , he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement , a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay , heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party . After Magsaysays election , he joined the government as special assistant to the Secretary of Labor and technical assistant on labor and agrarian affairs . Secretary of Labor . In 1965 , Ople was appointed as Social Security Commissioner by President Ferdinand E . Marcos . In 1967 , he was appointed Secretary of Labor and Employment ( in 1978 the position was renamed Minister of Labor and Employment ) . He resigned briefly in 1971 to run an unsuccessful campaign for election to the Philippine Senate , but was re-appointed to his post in 1972 , retaining the position until 1986 . At the time of his appointment , Ople was perceived as a leftist Nationalist . His leftist credentials were enhanced when he co-founded , in 1972 , the Philippine-Soviet Friendship Society . As Labor Secretary Ople was instrumental in the framing of the Labor Code of the Philippines , which codified the labor laws of the country and introduced innovations such as prohibiting the termination of workers without legal cause . Ople instituted labor policies institutionalizing the technical education of workers . In 1976 , Ople initiated a program for the overseas employment of Filipino workers . It was during his tenure at Labor that the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration were created . Ople obtained recognition from the International Labour Organization during his stint as Labor Minister . In 1975 , he was elected president of the 60th International Labour Conference of the ILO , the first Filipino to hold that post . In 1983 , that organization awarded Ople a Gold Medal of Appreciation . He was a close adviser of President Marcos , though he was not later to be associated with the corruption of the Marcos government and was perceived as not corrupt . He created international headlines in December 1984 when he admitted to the press that the lupus-stricken Marcos was incapacitated to the point of being unable to take major initiatives , and that the Presidents illness had placed the Philippines in a kind of interregnum . Marcos responded a few days later by baring his chest to his Cabinet before television cameras to dispel rumors that he was seriously ill or had undergone surgery . In 1978 , Ople was elected an Assemblyman of the Interim Batasang Pambansa representing Central Luzon , and reelected in 1984 . During the 1986 presidential elections , Ople served as a political campaign manager of President Marcos , who was running against Corazon Aquino . Shortly before the outbreak of the 1986 People Power Revolution , Marcos dispatched Ople to Washington , D.C . to lobby the American government on behalf of the President . Ople was in Washington D.C . upon the outbreak of the revolt , and was advised by U.S . Secretary of State , George P . Shultz , to call on Marcos to resign . Ople publicly reiterated his support for Marcos in the American media in such fora as on This Week with David Brinkley . 1986 Constitutional Commission Member . Following the success of the People Power Revolution and the installation to the presidency of Corazon Aquino , Ople was relieved of his Cabinet post . Ople returned to the Philippines and immediately attempted to position himself as the leader of the political opposition against Aquino . Nonetheless in May 1986 , Ople accepted an offer by President Aquino to serve in the Constitutional Commission that drafted a new Philippine Constitution . In the 1987 congressional elections , Ople ran a second time for the Philippine Senate , under the banner of the nationalist-led Grand Alliance for Democracy coalition . He was defeated in this attempt , and returned to private life , serving as chairman of the Institute for Public Policy ( IPP ) , a policy research institute . Senator of the Philippines . In 1992 , he ran again for the Senate under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino . He was elected to a six-year term . In the Senate , Ople served as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and on the Commission of Appointments . He became Senate President Pro-Tempore in 1998 . Ople won a re-election for the senate in 1998 , under the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino . In 1999 , upon the resignation of the terminally-ill Marcelo Fernan , Ople became the President of the Senate . In that capacity , he was a key proponent of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and the United States , which allowed American forces to enter the Philippines for short-term training exercises . He yielded the Senate presidency in 2000 to Franklin Drilon . Later that year , he sat as one of the senator-judges in the impeachment trial of his ally , President Joseph Estrada . He was one of the eleven votes during the trial that successfully voted to block the opening of an envelope that was believed to contain proof of the corruption charges against Estrada . Public anger over the Senate vote triggered the EDSA Revolution of 2001 , leading to the ouster of Estrada and the accession of Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to the presidency . Secretary of Foreign Affairs . In July 2002 , President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Ople , a member of the political opposition in the Senate , as Secretary of Foreign Affairs in her cabinet . The appointment was with some controversy . Weeks earlier , Arroyos hand-picked Vice-President Teofisto Guingona had resigned as Foreign Affairs Secretary after voicing disagreement with the plan of the Philippine and United States governments to allow American troops to help combat Islamic terrorist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf as part of the post-9/11 War on Terror . Ople , who had earlier been a vocal supporter of the 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement , was perceived to be more amenable to the plan . In addition , left-wing labor activists denounced the appointment of Ople , citing his Marcos-era role in promoting overseas employment of Filipino workers which , they said , had resulted in abuses inflicted on Filipino workers abroad . During his stint as Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Ople was at the forefront of the negotiations that led to the deployment of American military forces inside the Philippines , though he insisted that the American troops would not participate in combat missions . Under his watch , the American and Filipino governments signed an agreement that provided immunity to each others citizens facing charges before international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court . Ople was also a vocal supporter of the Iraq War , and pushed for the deployment of a small Filipino contingent in Iraq . He predicted in November 2003 , Baghdad will be transformed from a symbol of brutal despotism to a new , shining symbol of human freedom . The sacrifices invested in the liberation of Iraq , to which Filipinos made a significant contribution , will be fully vindicated and cherished for all time . Death . In the months prior to his death , Ople , a longtime chain smoker , had suffered from ill health and often attended international conferences in a wheelchair . On the night of October 13 , 2003 , Ople had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness while aboard a Japan Asia Airways flight from Bangkok to Tokyo . The flight was diverted to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan County , Taiwan ( now Taoyuan City ) , and Ople was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was initially pronounced dead on arrival , but given medical treatment nonetheless . Efforts to revive him were futile , and his death on Tuesday , October 14 , 2003 was announced by his family . President Arroyo mourned Ople as an architect of Philippine foreign policy in the finest tradition of enlightened and pragmatic diplomacy , while U.S . Secretary of State Colin Powell hailed him as one of the pivotal figures of the late Twentieth Century for Philippine history . More critical of Ople , Teddy Casiño , secretary-general of the leftist coalition BAYAN , called him a political chameleon who tried to pass himself off as a nationalist but [ was ] most pro-American . Nonetheless , Casiño acknowledged that Ople was a consistent , brilliant and very astute politician . Ople was eulogized in Time Magazine , which recalled his erudition , his skill at political survival , and his trademark extraordinary baritone . The eulogy also said that at the height of the People Power Revolution , Ople in Washington , D.C . had reported to Marcos in Manila that the Presidents support within the Reagan administration was falling . Marcos responded by asking Ople to reach out to his contacts in the Soviet government . Ople rebuffed Marcos , and as Time noted , declined to help make the Philippines a Soviet colony three years before the Berlin Wall fell . Ople is buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani . In 2004 , President Arroyo named Oples daughter , Susan Ople , as Undersecretary of the Department of Labor and Employment .

Good Mary Lowe Good ( June 20 , 1931 – November 20 , 2019 ) was an American inorganic chemist who worked academically , in industrial research and in government . Good contributed to the understanding of catalysts such as ruthenium which activate or speed up chemical reactions . Good served as the Under Secretary for Technology in the United States Department of Commerce from 1993 to 1997 under President Bill Clinton . She briefly served as Acting United States Secretary of Commerce from April 3 , 1996 to April 12 , 1996 . Good received a number of significant awards including the Garvan–Olin Medal , the Othmer Gold Medal , the Priestley Medal , the Vannevar Bush Award , and the Heinz Award in Technology , the Economy , and Employment . Early life and education . Mary Lowe was born on June 20 , 1931 in Grapevine , Texas to Winnie and John Lowe . The family moved to Kirby , Arkansas in 1942 . Her father was a principal in a local school , and her mother was a teacher and librarian . The family later moved to Willisville , Arkansas , where Mary attended high school . No chemistry course or lab was offered at the school , so Mary would spend her time as a young student creating her own labs . She once produced a homemade photography studio in the cellar of her home after fixing up an old enlarger and reading up on the chemicals needed for photo developing . Lowe initially attended Arkansas State Teachers College ( now the University of Central Arkansas ) with the intention of being a home economics teacher . She became interested in chemistry as a freshman and changed her major to chemistry and physics , receiving her B.Sc . from the University of Central Arkansas in 1950 . Lowe became one of the first three students to graduate from the Universitys chemistry program . Her professors encouraged her to go to graduate school . She received a fellowship , which enabled her to study radiochemistry with Raymond R . Edwards at the University of Arkansas . At age 19 , as an atomic energy research assistant , she received her first Q-level government clearance . In 1952 , she married Bill Jewel Good , a fellow graduate student in physics . Mary Lowe Good received her MS in 1953 and her PhD in 1955 from the University of Arkansas becoming the first woman from Arkansas to earn a doctoral degree in the hard sciences . Her graduate work involved studying radioactive iodine in aqueous solutions ( used for treating thyroid conditions ) . She worked on processes of solvent extraction of metal complexes and described the chemical and physical properties of chemical species in an organic solvent . She was able to explain why solutions of radioactive iodine were unstable , and determine the concentration at which species would be at equilibrium values , by applying the Nernst equation effect . Louisiana State University System . Good spent 25 years in teaching and research at Louisiana State University and the University of New Orleans , which was at the time part of the Louisiana State University System . Good went to Baton Rouge as director of the radiochemistry laboratory and as an instructor and assistant professor of chemistry ( 1954–1958 ) . At Baton Rouge she worked on iodine and sulfur chemistry with Sean McGlynn . In 1958 Good and her husband moved to New Orleans when both were offered positions at a new campus that was being established . The Louisiana State University New Orleans ( LSUNO ) was the first university in the southern states to open as a fully integrated institution . Expanding on her work in radiochemistry , Good became interested in using spectroscopy to study inorganic chemistry compounds , taking measurements and relating experimental results to theoretical predictions . She was able to study molecular bonding in both solutions and solid states . She also was able to extract rhodium complexes , using organic solvents , and demonstrate that they were bimetallic . Good moved up the academic ranks to become the Boyd Professor of Chemistry at New Orleans ( 1974–1978 ) , the first woman to achieve the universitys most distinguished rank . From 1978–1980 , she returned to Baton Rouge to develop a new program as the Boyd Professor of Materials Science , Division of Engineering Research . Good was one of the first people to use Mössbauer spectroscopy techniques for basic chemical research . Mössbauer spectroscopy enables researchers to study the interactions of gamma rays with matter , observing very small differences in the energy of electrons within atoms . This data can be used to identify the molecular structure of complicated compounds containing metal ions . Good contributed to the understanding of catalysts such as ruthenium which activate or speed up chemical reactions . At that time , no one had attempted to observe Mössbauer effects in ruthenium , in part because it had to be examined at extremely low temperatures , cooled by liquid helium . Good was able to study ruthenium , which exists in a variety of oxidation states , and derive detailed chemical and structural information . She also did work in materials science on the physical and biological investigations of marine antifouling coatings , used to remove barnacles from ships . Her publications include more than 100 articles in refereed journals and several books . American Chemical Society . Good was the first woman to be elected to the board of the American Chemical Society in 1972 . She was elected ACS Board Chairman in 1978 and 1980 , and became ACS President elect as of 1986 , serving as president in 1987 . International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry . Good was also elected President of the inorganic chemistry division of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) in 1981 , and held the position until 1985 , for two terms . She was the first woman to be elected a division head of IUPAC . As head of the inorganic chemistry division , she was responsible for overseeing the work of the commissions on nomenclature for inorganic chemistry ; the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights , and the commission on high temperatures and refractory materials . Her work included supervising a complete revision of the IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry or Red Book . In addition to holding the position of division president ( 1980–1985 ) , Good served on IUPACs Governing Bureau ( 1985–1993 ) . She became an elected member ( EM ) of the bureau after her second term as division president , and served on the Executive Committee ( EC ) of IUPAC from 1985–1993 . In 1989 , Good was instrumental in introducing the Chemistry in Action program , encouraging IUPAC members to become active and visible leaders in areas of scientific and social importance , including the atmosphere and the environment , energy processes , advanced materials , and bio-technology . Good also served on the board of directors of the Industrial Research Institute ( IRI , 1982-1987 ) . Industrial career . In 1980 , Mary Lowe Good was approached to become head of the Engineered Materials Research division at Signal Research Center , Inc . ( previously Universal Oil Products , later Allied-Signal Inc. ) , with a staff of 400 scientists and technicians and annual sales of approximately $3 billion . In 1981 Mary Good was chosen as Vice-President and Director of Research . She headed the Research Center during a period of significant changes ( ownership , mergers , acquisitions and divestitures ) , maintaining a focus on new technology development and its licensing and commercialization . She became President and director of research for Signal Research Center in 1985 , and President of Allied-Signal Engineered Materials Research in 1986 and then the Senior Vice-President of Technology , coordinating the activities of three research centers . Government service . Mary Lowe Good held government positions under the administrations of four presidents : Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , George H . W . Bush , and Bill Clinton . In 1980 she was appointed to the National Science Board of the National Science Foundation by Jimmy Carter . In 1986 she was appointed to it again by Ronald Reagan . From 1988 to 1991 , she was the first woman to chair the board . In 1991 President Bush appointed her to the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ( PCAST ) . All three positions were part-time commitments , held during the period in which she worked at Allied-Signal Inc . In 1993 , Good left Allied Signal to take a four-year full-time position as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology in the Technology Administration , under the Clinton Administration . During this time Good led the Clean Car Initiative to develop a hybrid gas-electric car . She encouraged the government to fund basic research and emerging technologies . Good was appointed Acting United States Secretary of Commerce on April 3 , 1996 , following the death of Ronald H . Brown , until Mickey Kantor was appointed 9 days later by Bill Clinton . University of Arkansas at Little Rock . In 1997 Good became the Donaghey University Professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock . She also became the founding Dean of the George W .

Early life . Alexander Michael Prochoroff was born on 11 July 1916 at Russell Road Peeramon , Queensland , Australia ( now 322 Gadaloff Road , Butchers Creek , situated about 30 km from Atherton ) , to Mikhail Ivanovich Prokhorov and Maria Ivanovna ( née Mikhailova ) , Russian revolutionaries who had emigrated from Russia to escape repression by the tsarist government . As a child he attended Butchers Creek School . In 1923 , after the October Revolution , the family returned to Russia . In 1934 , Prokhorov entered the Saint Petersburg State University to study physics . He was a member of the Komsomol from 1930 to 1944 . Prokhorov graduated with honors in 1939 and moved to Moscow to work at the Lebedev Physical Institute , in the oscillations laboratory headed by academician N . D . Papaleksi . His research there was devoted to propagation of radio waves in the ionosphere . At the onset of World War II in the Soviet Union , in June 1941 , he joined the Red Army . During World War II , Prokhorov fought in the infantry , was wounded twice in battles , and was awarded three medals , including the Medal For Courage in 1946 . He was demobilized in 1944 and returned to the Lebedev Institute where , in 1946 , he defended his Ph.D . thesis on Theory of Stabilization of Frequency of a Tube Oscillator in the Theory of a Small Parameter . Research . In 1947 , Prokhorov started working on coherent radiation emitted by electrons orbiting in a cyclic particle accelerator called a synchrotron . He demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the microwave spectral range . His results became the basis of his habilitation on Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the Synchrotron Accelerator , defended in 1951 . By 1950 , Prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory . Around that time , he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations , and later on quantum electronics . The group focused on a special class of molecules which have three ( non-degenerate ) moments of inertia . The research was conducted both on experiment and theory . In 1954 , Prokhorov became head of the laboratory . Together with Nikolay Basov he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia . They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields . Their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952 , but not published until 1954–1955 ; In 1955 , Prokhorov started his research in the field of electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) . He focused on relaxation times of ions of the iron group elements in a lattice of aluminium oxide , but also investigated other , non-optical , topics , such as magnetic phase transitions in DPPH . In 1957 , while studying ruby , a chromium-doped variation of aluminium oxide , he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser . As a new type of laser resonator , he proposed , in 1958 , an open type cavity design , which is widely used today . In 1963 , together with A . S . Selivanenko , he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions . For his pioneering work on lasers and masers , in 1964 , he received the Nobel Prize in Physics shared with Nikolay Basov and Charles Hard Townes . Posts and awards . In 1959 , Prokhorov became a professor at Moscow State University – the most prestigious university in the Soviet Union ; the same year , he was awarded the Lenin Prize . In 1960 , he became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and elected Academician in 1966 . In 1967 , he was awarded his first Order of Lenin ( he received five of them during life , in 1967 , 1969 , 1975 , 1981 and 1986 ) . In 1968 , he became vice-director of the Lebedev Institute and in 1971 took the position of Head of Laboratory of another prestigious Soviet institution , the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology . In the same year , he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . In 1983 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina . Between 1982 and 1998 , Prokhorov served as acting director of the General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and after 1998 as honorary director . After his death in 2002 , the institute was renamed the A . M . Prokhorov General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences . Prokhorov was a Member and one of the Honorary Presidents of the International Academy of Science , Munich and supported 1993 the foundation and development of the Russian Section of International Academy of Science , Moscow . In 1969 , Prokhorov became a Hero of Socialist Labour , the highest degree of distinction in the Soviet Union for achievements in national economy and culture . He received the second such award in 1986 . Starting in 1969 , he was the chief editor of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia . He was awarded the Frederic Ives Medal , the highest distinction of the Optical Society of America ( OSA ) , in 2000 and became an Honorary OSA Member in 2001 . The same year , he was awarded the Demidov Prize . Politics . Prokhorov became a member of the Communist Party in 1950 . In 1983 , together with three other academicians – Andrey Tychonoff , Anatoly Dorodnitsyn and Georgy Skryabin – he signed the famous open letter denouncing Andrey Sakharovs article in the Foreign Affairs . Family . Both of Prokhorovs parents died during World War II . Prokhorov married geographer Galina Shelepina in 1941 , and they had a son , Kiril , born in 1945 . Following his father , Kiril Prokhorov became a physicist in the field of optics and is currently leading a laser-related laboratory at the A . M . Prokhorov General Physics Institute .

For the next five years , the chain was operated as a subsidiary of Lowes and used for strategic expansion of retail operations . All stores were closed in November 2018 . In January 2020 , the Memphis-based Central Network Retail Group purchased the OSH brand from Lowes . History . Orchard Supply was formed in 1931 as the Orchard Supply Farmers Co-op by 30 farmers , consisting mostly of orchardists and fruit tree ranchers who banded together to form a cooperative to buy essential farm supplies . Each farmer put up $30 and in the midst of the Great Depression a new company was formed . Stanley B . Smith served as the companys first general manager and president . Operations started in a rented warehouse at 230 Bassett St . in San Jose , CA . In spite of the Great Depression , the cooperative was successful . In 1933 the co-op moved to a larger location at 44 Vine St . in San Jose . The new location featured a large retail display area , off-street parking , and an adjoining warehouse . In 1946 the company moved to a site at 720 West San Carlos St . in San Jose . By then , there were almost 2000 members . In 1962 , Albert B . Smith ( Stanleys son ) became president , expanding the business into a chain of stores which , at each , were considered large at the time . By 1950 the electronics industry began booming in the Santa Clara Valley , and with it came an abundance of new home owners in the San Francisco Bay Area . The orchards gradually became residential neighborhoods , and the Orchard Supply Farmers Co-op became a for-profit corporation , Orchard Supply Hardware retail stores . In 1977 , the company purchased a 19-acre warehouse and office complex from Sunsweet Growers to serve as a distribution center . In the 1980s , Loren S . Smith ( another son of Stanley ) became President and continued the expansion . In 1992 the distribution center was moved to Tracy , CA . On August 22 , 2018 , Lowes publicly announced that Orchard Supply Hardware would be closed down nationwide , and would begin liquidation . It said stores would be closed by the following February , and all had been closed by November . In 2019 , Central Network Retail Group ( CNRG ) purchased leases to 7 former OSH locations in the San Jose area . These new stores were to be called Outdoor Supply Hardware , and kept a similar appearance and experience as the old OSH stores . By 2020 , the chain expanded to 11 locations . Operations . Mergers and acquisitions . Orchard Supply Hardware ceased to be a privately owned company when it and its seven stores were acquired by W.R . Grace and Company in 1979 . W.R . Grace operated the company seven years before it sold the company along with another hardware chain to the Wickes Companies in 1986 . Wickes operated the company for three years before selling the company to its managers in 1989 . OSH was purchased by Sears in 1996 after seven years of independence . In 2005 , Sears sold a 19.9% interest in the company to Ares Management of Los Angeles for US$58.7 million , announcing expansion plans at the time . Ares had the option to later purchase another 30.2% stake in the company for US$126.8 million , but did not exercise this right . OSH had eighty-four stores at the time . At roughly the same time , Sears Holdings announced that its Sears , Roebuck &amp; Co . subsidiary expected to receive a dividend from OSH of about US$450 million . In connection with the initial investment , OSH was expected to issue US$405 million in debt . This debt was later cited as one of the primary reasons for its 2013 Chapter 11 filing . Later several of the Southern California locations of the bankrupt Builders Emporium chain of hardware stores were purchased in preparation of expansion into that region . OSH was spun out of Sears Holdings in 2012 and became a public company . In January 2012 shares began trading on the Nasdaq stock market ( ) . Expansion . In April 2013 , OSH expanded beyond California , opening stores in the suburban Portland metropolitan area of Oregon . In November 2014 , the company opened its first location in the city of San Francisco . The North Beach store located at 2598 Taylor St . is a former Petco and has a planned June 2015 opening . The store represents a new strategy for Lowes to enter urban regions and markets using the OSH brand . This was following the opening of a store in the population dense Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles . Reorganization . On June 17 , 2013 , Orchard Supply Hardware announced it filed for Chapter 11 under the U.S . bankruptcy code and that most of its assets would be sold to the Lowes Home Improvement chain for $205M in cash . Lowes agreed to acquire no fewer than sixty of the ( at the time ) ninety-one Orchard Supply stores , operating them separately from Lowes . At the close of the process , Orchard Supply remained a separate brand and operating entity from the Lowes chain . In August 2013 , preparations were made to close seventeen of the ninety-nine stores . Two of the stores were closed in June as a part of normal operations . This left seventy of the pre-Chapter 11 announcement stores still in operation . According to a company spokesperson , workers at the stores that closed were not eligible for severance pay due to the bankruptcy proceeding , but Orchard Supply is providing incentive bonuses to key employees . Lowes also committed to investing US$200 million in OSH over the next five years . In 2016 , Lowes announced the expansion of the Orchard brand to South Florida . Technology . Via a technology program launched initially by Lowes in 2014 , OSH announced a pilot program using robot employees at their San Jose store at 377 Royal Ave . The devices , called OSHbots , were supplied by a Mountain View company called Fellow Robots . The OSHbots resembled white columns with two large LCD screens and were equipped with 3D cameras , so they could identify items brought in by customers , and had wheels on either side that helped them move . Customers could research items on the screens and then the robot could lead them to the aisle where an item was located . The robots spoke English and Spanish and were connected to an inventory database so they could inform customers if an item was out of stock . The robots were the result of a process that Lowes uses for new developments . According to Lowes Innovation Labs director Kyle Nel , What we actually do is use a process called science fiction prototyping , where we give all our marketing research and trend data to professional published science fiction writers . The OSHbots were not meant to replace humans , but Nel also stated , We have amazing [ OSH ] store associates , but.. . they probably dont know the real time location of every single object in the store . Marketing . Boxcar . In the early 1960s , the City of San José denied Al Smith permission to install a sign along Auzerais Street to promote his Orchard Supply Hardware store because a sign for the store already existed facing San Carlos Street . Undeterred , Smith bought a railroad boxcar from Southern Pacific , painted the car with the OSH logo , and placed it at the end of the spur track behind his store and alongside Auzerais Street . It remained in that spot for nearly 50 years , and was occasionally featured in OSH’s promotional material . Recognizing its historic relationship to the San José community , OSH donated the boxcar to the California Trolley and Railroad Corporation in 2013 for display in History Park at Kelley Park . Calendars . Originally conceived as a marketing program , company president , Al Smith who had worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad , had a love of trains and is credited with the theme . One aspect that initially made these calendars unique was that all original paintings were commissioned as artwork for each month . The theme of these calendars has primarily been trains and railroad history , with only a few diversions , including the 1981 calendar which celebrated the Santa Clara Valley . Other images have featured landscapes , steam-powered machines , automobiles , historical drawings , produce from the Santa Clara Valley . From 1975 until 1992 , railroad artist and local politician Michael Kotowski created each painting with the exception of the 1977 and 1979 calendars . The 1977 edition was a selection of “Still Live” paintings by the Santa Cruz Art League and the 1979 edition was a series of Southwestern style paintings by Northern California artist Anthony Quartuccio , Sr . The 1982 calendar had a flight and aviation theme called “Up , Up and Away” for which Kotowski created the original artwork even though it was not train related . Kotowski did the layout design and production on the entire series under his tenure as artist . OSHs calendars have featured the works of twenty-three different artists who have created over 450 unique pieces including railroad artists such as Kotowski , John Winfield , James R Mann , 2017 Calendar , and Ken Muramoto ; Muramoto has the distinction of being the youngest artist to provide paintings for the calendar .</p><p>question: What was the parent organization of Orchard Supply Hardware from 2013 to 2014?</p><p>pred: Lowes</p><p>context_time: After starting as a non-profit cooperative in 1931 , the company later converted into a for-profit corporation before it was bought and sold by a number of different corporations during the 1980s .

Early life . He was born in the Caucasus and was of Georgian descent . He was kidnapped and taken to Constantinople as a youth , converted to Islam and enrolled in the Janissaries . There he acquired the favour of Sultan Mahmud II and occupied several high positions . Egypt ( 1801–05 ) . Appointed mayor of Alexandria after the French evacuated Egypt in 1801 , he was named governor of Egypt in 1804 at Muhammad Alis behest . Allied with Britains diplomatic representative , Hurshid tried to get Muhammad Ali and his Albanians removed from Egypt , bringing in the deli ( lit . madmen ) light cavalry from Ottoman Syria to counterbalance them . Muhammad Ali won the Delis to his side and , backed by a demonstration of ulema and guild leaders in Cairo , had himself named governor of Egypt in May 1805 . Hurshid , abandoned by his troops , was besieged in the Cairo Citadel , which he left only after he saw the Ottoman firman investing Muhammad Ali as Egypts governor . Rumelia . In 1808 , Hurshid Pasha served as the governor of Rumelia . Suppression of the Serbian Revolution . In March 1809 , he was sent to Serbia ( the Sanjak of Smederevo ) to repress the First Serbian Uprising led by Karađorđe Petrović . On 5 September 1812 he was named Grand Vizier ( Prime Minister ) , a post he held until 1 April 1815 . He remained on campaign in Serbia as commander-in-chief ( serasker ) , and brought the uprising to an end after recapturing Belgrade in October 1813 . In that year he was named governor of the Eyalet of Bosnia and from that position he campaigned with success against the Second Serbian Uprising led by Miloš Obrenović . Suppression of Ali Pashas revolt and Greek Revolution . In November 1820 , he was named Mora valisi , governor of the Morea Eyalet ( the Peloponnese ) , with seat at Tripoli and serasker of the expedition against the rebellious Ali Pasha of Yanina . Before he left for Yanina , however , he was disturbed by rumours of a possible revolt among the Greeks of the Morea . His fears were allayed , however , when an assembly of Greek notables visited him on 8 November 1820 in Tripoli . Thus , on 6 January 1821 , he left Tripoli for the north , leaving behind his treasury and his harem , while his deputy ( kaimakam ) Mehmed Salih with a force of 1,000 Albanians remained to maintain order . However , only a few months later , while the Ottoman armies were besieging Yanina , the first uprisings of the Greek War of Independence took place . Hurshid immediately informed the Sultan of the events , and without waiting for instructions , reacted by sending Omer Vryonis and Köse Mehmed Pasha to suppress the revolt first in Central Greece and then to cross over to the Peloponnese and quell the uprising in its heartland . At the same time , he dispatched his chief of staff Mustafa Bey with 3,000 men to reinforce the garrison of Tripoli . Hurshid himself remained in Yanina to supervise the last stages of the siege . Despite his rapid reaction , his plans ultimately failed : Vryonis and Köse Mehmed failed to suppress the revolt in Central Greece , while the reinforcements of Mustafa Bey were insufficient to save Tripoli , which fell to the Greeks under Theodoros Kolokotronis after a prolonged siege , on 23 September 1821 . Despite the general massacre of the Muslim inhabitants , Hurshids harem and a part of his treasure were saved . Finally , in January 1822 , he killed Ali Pasha through treason , and sent his severed head to the Sultan , and his star seemed on the rise again . He assembled an army of 80,000 men ( a huge number by Balkan standards ) and was about to march in order to finally crush the Greek uprising , when disaster struck . His political enemies in Constantinople , alarmed at the fame and power he had achieved and the prestige that the successful ending of both Ali Pashas and the Greek revolts would bring him , accused him of misappropriating a large part of Alis treasure . Hurshid had sent 40,000,000 piasters , with a statement that they had been found in Alis vaults , while the Sultans ministers calculated Alis fortune at over 500,000,000 piasters . When they asked him to send a detailed account , the offended Hurshid did not reply . Shortly after that , he was denounced for abuse of public treasure and fell in disgrace . He was removed from his positions , and replaced as serasker and mora valisi by Mahmud Dramali Pasha . Hurshid was ordered to remain in Larissa to attend to the provisioning of Dramalis army . When news began arriving in Constantinople of the failure of Dramalis expedition at Dervenakia , the Sultan ordered Hurshid to take matters in his own hand and salvage what he could of the situation . However , his opponents continued to plot against him , and agents were sent to kill him . Although he was informed of the threat to his person , Hurshid did not react . Instead , he ordered the post-haste construction of a very tomb , and arranged for a very elaborate funeral with all authorities present , without telling anyone who these arrangements were made for . Then he called all authorities , attended his own funeral , and upon completion of the ceremony he committed suicide by taking poison in front of everyone , on 30 November 1822 . Despite the public nature of his death , the Sultans emissaries still had to exhume him and take his head to the Sultan , as these were their orders</p><p>question: Which position did Hurshid Pasha hold from 1804 to 1805?</p><p>pred: governor of Egypt</p><p>context_time: Appointed mayor of Alexandria after the French evacuated Egypt in 1801 , he was named governor of Egypt in 1804 at Muhammad Alis behest .

England Gordon Richard England ( born September 15 , 1937 ) is an American politician and businessman who was the U.S . Deputy Secretary of Defense and twice as U.S . Secretary of the Navy in the administration of U.S . President George W . Bush . Early life . England was born on September 15 , 1937 in Baltimore , Maryland . England attended Mount Saint Joseph High School , graduating with the class of 1955 . Education . England received a bachelors degree in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland , College Park in 1961 and an MBA from the Texas Christian University in 1975 . He was a member of several fraternities including Beta Gamma Sigma ( business ) , Omicron Delta Kappa ( leadership ) and Eta Kappa Nu ( electrical engineering ) . Career . England started his business career in 1966 at Honeywell where he was an engineer on the Project Gemini space program . He worked for Litton Industries as a program manager on the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft for the United States Navy . He was also CEO of GRE Consultants . By 1977 he was employed by General Dynamics Fort Worth Division where he held various posts including Director of Avionics . He was later named as the Vice President of Engineering , and later President and general manager , of General Dynamics Land Systems Division , eventually transitioning back to General Dynamics Fort Worth as Division President . England remained in that post when General Dynamics sold the Fort Worth Division to Lockheed ; later becoming President of that corporation for four years . England returned to General Dynamics as Executive Vice President of the Combat Systems Group . He served from 1997 to 2001 as Executive Vice President of General Dynamics where he had overall responsibility for Information Systems and International sectors . England transferred from the business world to government during the administration of U.S . President George W . Bush serving in a number of key roles , having previously served as a member of the Defense Science Board . 72nd Secretary of the Navy . England was a controversial choice for Secretary of the Navy due to his lack of any military service experience and his long career in the defense industry including his most recent appointment as Executive Vice President of General Dynamics Corporation . Critics such as William D . Hartung , Head of the Arms Trade Resource Center , felt that it was inappropriate to appoint businessmen whose companies would be the prime benefactor of any increase in defense spending . U.S . Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld however had decided to make corporate experience one of the key requirements in his appointees as was reported in the Washington Times . This policy led to Englands appointment alongside other leading industrialists including James Roche and Thomas E . White . England was sworn in on May 24 , 2001 . He is reported in the Washington Post as having announced that one of his key aims in the role was the development of futuristic weapons to counter new types of threats emerging in the post-Soviet world . The Washington Post reports that during his time in this role England has joined with Adm . Vernon Clark , chief of naval operations , in directing some of the most sweeping change the service has seen in decades . The report goes on to list the following ; - Retiring dozens of ships - Shedding thousands of jobs , - Consolidating Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation forces - Juggling crew deployments to keep some ships at sea longer - Devising plans to surge more warships into action faster during a crisis . By an instruction dated May 31 , 2002 , England directed all United States Navy ships to fly the first navy jack in honor of those killed in the September 11 , 2001 attacks . The jack is to be flown for the duration of the War on Terrorism . England left the post in January 2003 for a new position within the administration . 1st Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security . On January 24 , 2003 England took up his new role as Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security in the newly formed United States Department of Homeland Security . Although Englands stint in this post was brief , a close associate quoted in the Washington Post states that it broadened his exposure to the White House and his contact base in Washington . 73rd Secretary of the Navy . England was recalled to once again take on the role of Secretary of the Navy after just a few months following the suicide of his nominated replacement Colin R . McMillan . England was sworn in on October 1 , 2003 becoming only the second person to hold the post twice and the first to serve back-to-back terms . According to a close associate quoted in the Washington Post , Englands time in the United States Department of Homeland Security had expanded [ his ] view of the administrations war on terrorism , which led to a number of initiatives that he pursued in his second term at the Pentagon including stronger ties between the Navy and Coast Guard and a greater assistance to Marines on the front lines in Iraq In June 2004 , a Supreme Court ruling granted prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba the right to plead their cases in U.S . courts . As the BBC pointed out the 600 detainees had been in legal limbo since their capture during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan , during which time only three detainees had been charged and several dozen had been sent back home following diplomatic pressure from other nations . England was appointed to head the review that was conducted in secret by a panel consisting of three military officers to whom prisoners were given the chance to provide facts to support their case for release . England made clear that The question is : Are they still threats to America ? Its not guilt or innocence . As a result of this review 38 prisoners were released due to a lack of evidence that England referred to as ‘thin files’ . England was succeeded as Secretary of the Navy by Donald C . Winter . Deputy Secretary of Defense . England was nominated as Deputy Secretary of Defense on May 13 , 2005 and immediately took up the role in an acting capacity while awaiting his confirmation . His replacement of Paul Wolfowitz has been looked upon favorably in the media with the Washington Post commenting , England has a reputation for being less ideological than Wolfowitz and more attuned to the administrative demands of the Pentagons second-ranking civilian job but critics still maintain that his prime loyalty remains to the defense industry . England was recess appointed to the full Deputy Secretary position on January 4 , 2006 by President Bush . He resigned with the incoming Obama administration . Acting Secretary of Defense . On January 22 , 2009 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told reporters he would hand off his duties to Gordon R . England during his January 23 surgery . On January 23 , 2009 , while Gates underwent two hours of surgery to repair a torn tendon in his left biceps , Gordon England was in charge of the Pentagon . England continued this service while Gates recovered from the surgery . During this time , England was the acting Defense Secretary . Other activities and awards .

West Stephen Craig West FRS ( born 11 April 1952 ) is a British biochemist and molecular biologist specialising in research on DNA recombination and repair . He is known for pioneering studies on genome instability diseases including cancer . West obtained his BSc in 1974 , and his PhD in 1977 , both from Newcastle University . He is currently a Senior Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London . He is an honorary Professor at University College London , and at Imperial College London . He was awarded the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine in 2007 , is a fellow of the Royal Society , the Academy of Medical Sciences , an International Member of the National Academy of Sciences , and an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . Early life and education . Stephen West was born on 11 April 1952 in Hessle , Yorkshire , to Joseph Clair West , a fishbuyer , and Louise West . Although he came from a working-class background , he did well enough at his local school ( Hessle High School ) to go to Newcastle University where he studied Biochemistry . He graduated with a BSc in 1974 , and stayed in Newcastle to complete his PhD in 1977 . His thesis advisor was Peter Emmerson . Career . During his PhD work , he became interested in how cells recombine their DNA and use recombination for DNA repair . In 1977 , he identified ‘protein X’ as the elusive RecA protein , which is essential for recombination and repair in bacteria . After finishing his PhD , which he completed within three years , he moved to the United States to join the group led by Paul Howard-Flanders , one of the early pioneers in the field of DNA repair . In 1985 , West moved back to the United Kingdom and established his own group at the Imperial Cancer Research Funds laboratories in South Mimms in Hertfordshire , which subsequently became known as Cancer Research UK . His colleagues at Clare Hall laboratory included the Nobel Prize winners Tim Hunt and Tomas Lindahl . In 2016 , his laboratory moved to the new Francis Crick Institute in London . Research . Highlights of research . In the Howard-Flanders group at Yale University , West purified and characterised RecA protein , and in doing so discovered many key aspects relating to the way that cells mediate DNA-DNA interactions and strand exchange . Parallel studies were carried out in the groups of Charles Radding ( also at Yale University ) and Robert Lehman ( Stanford University ) . These three laboratories provided the groundwork for our current understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms of recombination . After moving to the UK in 1985 , West continued his work in bacterial systems , and set about trying to identify cellular proteins capable of resolving recombination intermediates . He identified RuvC as the first cellular enzyme that resolves recombination intermediates and characterised how this nuclease cuts Holliday junctions . He was also the first to show that RuvA and RuvB are motor proteins that mediate Holliday junction branch migration . His biochemical studies were compounded by genetic work from the laboratory of Robert Lloyd ( University of Nottingham ) . West’s laboratory then moved into eukaryotic systems , where he discovered eukaryotic Holliday junction resolvases ( yeast Yen1 and human GEN1 ) . The identification of GEN1 was the culmination of 18 years of research , and opened up the field to allow a genetic analysis of the pathways by which recombination intermediates are processed . Present understanding indicates that there are three distinct pathways of Holliday junction processing in human cells involving BLM-topoIIIα-RMI1-RMI2 , MUS81-EME1 and GEN1 . His laboratory discovered that the Holliday junction resolvase activities of MUS81 and GEN1 are regulated so that they act late in the cell cycle to ensure chromosome segregation . In addition to the discovery of cellular Holliday junction resolvases , West was the first to purify the human RAD51 protein ( the eukaryotic ortholog of RecA ) , and to show that it promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions similar to those mediated by RecA . In addition , he purified and then visualised the BRCA2 breast cancer tumour suppressor , showing that it acts as a molecular chaperone for the association RAD51 with DNA . His laboratory also discovered that Aprataxin , which is defective in a progressive neurological disorder known as Oculomotor apraxia , is a 5-deadenylase that removes AMP from 5-termini following abortive DNA ligation . As it is clear that DNA repair plays a critical role in the maintenance of genome stability and cancer avoidance , West’s work is significant in terms of understanding the molecular basis of human disease . He is in great demand as an international speaker , and gives several keynote lectures each year as a fine communicator of the intricacies of DNA recombination and repair . Other professional activities . West is on the editorial boards of a number of journals including e-Life ( 2014-2016 ) , EMBO Journal ( 1996-2020 ) and EMBO Reports . He has been a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Leibniz Institute on Aging , Fritz Lippman Institute , Jena , Germany , and is currently on the SABs of the Center for Chromosome Instability , University of Copenhagen , Denmark , the China Medical University ( Taiwan ) , the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Genome Stability in Shenzen , China , and the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry , Martinsreid , Germany . He is a serial conference organiser , having organised ( or co-organised ) more than 30 conferences throughout his career . Currently , he is the organiser of the biennial International Conference on ‘Mechanisms of Recombination’ . The next meeting in the series will take place in May 2023 . Honours and awards .

Early life and education . Stephen West was born on 11 April 1952 in Hessle , Yorkshire , to Joseph Clair West , a fishbuyer , and Louise West . Although he came from a working-class background , he did well enough at his local school ( Hessle High School ) to go to Newcastle University where he studied Biochemistry . He graduated with a BSc in 1974 , and stayed in Newcastle to complete his PhD in 1977 . His thesis advisor was Peter Emmerson . Career . During his PhD work , he became interested in how cells recombine their DNA and use recombination for DNA repair . In 1977 , he identified ‘protein X’ as the elusive RecA protein , which is essential for recombination and repair in bacteria . After finishing his PhD , which he completed within three years , he moved to the United States to join the group led by Paul Howard-Flanders , one of the early pioneers in the field of DNA repair . In 1985 , West moved back to the United Kingdom and established his own group at the Imperial Cancer Research Funds laboratories in South Mimms in Hertfordshire , which subsequently became known as Cancer Research UK . His colleagues at Clare Hall laboratory included the Nobel Prize winners Tim Hunt and Tomas Lindahl . In 2016 , his laboratory moved to the new Francis Crick Institute in London . Research . Highlights of research . In the Howard-Flanders group at Yale University , West purified and characterised RecA protein , and in doing so discovered many key aspects relating to the way that cells mediate DNA-DNA interactions and strand exchange .

He was the elder son of Count John Francis William de Salis ( 1825–1871 ) , a diplomat and numismatist of Hillingdon , and Amelia Frances Harriet ( 1837 – 8 January 1885 ) , eldest daughter of Christopher Tower , JP DL MP , ( 1800–84 ) , of Huntsmoor Park , Iver , Buckinghamshire , and of Weald Hall , Essex . Diplomatic career . After being educated at Eton ( 1877–1882 , Edward Compton Austen Leighs house ) he was nominated an attaché in the diplomatic service on 20 November 1886 . He passed a competitive examination on 14 January 1887 . On 12 June 1888 he was appointed to Brussels as an attaché and promoted to Third Secretary on 14 January 1889 . From 24 April 1892 he served in Madrid , and was promoted to Second Secretary on 22 August 1893 . From August 1894 he served in Cairo under Lord Cromer in charge of the agency there when the Dervishes were active ( he was granted an allowance for knowledge of Arabic on 2 April 1895 ) . In autumn 1897 he was in Berlin , in 1899 in Brussels and from 1901 in Athens , as head of chancery ( dealing with the Macedonian problem ) . He was promoted to First Secretary on 1 April 1904 . He was employed between 1901–06 at the Foreign Office in London , and appointed a British Delegate for negotiation of a new Commercial Convention with Romania on 7 September 1905 . He served as Berlin chargé daffaires and counsellor of embassy from 1 July 1906 to 1911 , and was a British delegate at the International Copyright Conference at Berlin , October–November 1908 . From November 1911 to 1916 he served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the King of Montenegro at Cettinjé , and was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary on a special mission to the Holy See in 1916–1923 , ( Pope Benedict XV 1916-1922 , and same to Pope Pius XI 1922-1923 ) . He was a member of the 1931 Malta Royal Commission ( report issued in a blue book , 11 February 1932 ) . De Salis Report . In 1919 the British Government sent de Salis to investigate the Serbian occupation of Montenegro , but his resulting report was suppressed . Alexander Devine in The Martyred Nation , 1924 wrote : The fact is the Report contains such a damning indictment of Serbian rule that its publication would immediately provoke interference ; and that interference did not suit our policy towards the French Government . In the House of Commons , Ronald McNeill repeatedly asked about production of the Report and De Saliss possible arrest . But as Devine put it : When the day came that Mr . McNeill found himself Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the late Conservative Ministry , the Report was on his desk in the Foreign Office and Mr . McNeill could no more disclose its contents than his predecessors could . Meanwhile , Lord Sydenham in the House of Lords , Hansard , 29 November 1920 said : In a letter , dated New York , 1 May 1922 , published in The New York Times , 7 May 1922 , Ronald Tree described the Count as : ..perhaps the greatest English authority on the Balkans . In April 1920 , months after the possible event , an alleged arrest and imprisonment by the Serbians , the New York Times reported : The sensitivity of the issue is shown by the fact that only one of his four obituaries in The Times ( 1939 ) ( 19 January 1939 , page 17 , column D ) mentions his Montenegran Report , although not the arrest . Marriage . He married in 1890 Hélène Marie de Riquet , Comtesse de Caraman-Chimay ( 18 August 1864 – 31 May 1902 ) , daughter of Marie Eugène Auguste de Riquet , Prince de Caraman-Chimay , son of Joseph de Riquet de Caraman ( 1808-1886 ) , 17th Prince de Chimay and 1st Prince de Caraman .

Founded in 1992 , the company is best known for developing multiple edutainment franchises , most prominently Putt-Putt , Freddi Fish , Pajama Sam and Spy Fox , which , combined , sold over 15 million copies and earned more than 400 awards of excellence . Humongous Entertainment was acquired by GT Interactive ( later renamed Infogrames , Inc. , then Atari , Inc. ) in July 1996 . By October 2000 , sales of Humongous games had surpassed 16 million copies . GT sold Humongous to its parent company , Infogrames ( later renamed Atari SA ) , in August 2005 , as a result of which the company was shut down a few months after . Infogrames transitioned the label to a new company , Humongous , Inc. , which continued publishing games under the Humongous label until 2013 , when it faced bankruptcy . As part of the bankruptcy agreement of the Atari SA subsidiary Atari , Inc. , Humongous , Inc . and Atari Interactive , Tommo acquired the Humongous brand and all of its assets , and went on to re-release some of its games into digital distribution channels in conjunction with Night Dive Studios . History . Formation ( 1992–1996 ) . Humongous Entertainment was formed by Shelley Day and Ron Gilbert in 1992 , then based in Woodinville , Washington . The name Humongous Entertainment was suggested by Gilberts ex-LucasArts colleague , Tim Schafer . It became known for creating four point-and-click adventure game series intended for young children , branded collectively as Junior Adventures , with the four series being the Putt-Putt series , the Freddi Fish series , the Pajama Sam series and the Spy Fox series . Despite all four series being developed and released in parallel , characters from one series do not formally cross over with ones in another and instead appear as cameos or Easter eggs in any of the three other series . The company became the third largest childrens educational-software company . In 1995 , Gilbert and Day established a company division , Cavedog Entertainment , in Seattle , set to develop games of alternative genres , and released Total Annihilation , a real-time strategy ( RTS ) game , in 1997 . This was followed by two expansion packs in 1998 , as well as a variation called plus an expansion pack in 1999 . Acquisitions , decline , dissolution ( 1996–2006 ) . On July 11 , 1996 , Humongous Entertainment was purchased by GT Interactive for . In November 1997 , Humongous Entertainment signed a five-year worldwide deal with Nickelodeon to develop games based on the Nick Jr . series , Blues Clues , making it the first and only time that Humongous has developed games based on a licensed character as opposed to its original characters . In November 1999 , GT Interactive was acquired by Infogrames and renamed it Infogrames , Inc . In 2000 , Humongous Entertainment released a One-Stop Fun Shop activity center game for each Junior Adventure series , with the exception of Spy Fox . The co-founders tried to buy Humongous Entertainment back from Infogrames , Inc. , using external funding , but the day of the planned purchase was the day of the dot-com collapse , wherefore the funding was pulled . The founders soon left Humongous , alongside many other key employees , and formed a new studio , Hulabee Entertainment , in 2001 .

After starting his career in Flanders he moved abroad and worked in Amsterdam , Berlin , Mainz and Milan where he worked for an elite clientele . Life . Coxie was born in Mechelen some time between 1650 and 1670 in an artistic family with a long tradition going back to the 16th century . His father was the landscape painter Jan Coxie who was a great grandson of Michiel Coxie , one of the leading Flemish Renaissance painters who was known as the Flemish Raphael . His father Jan married Jeanne Biset in 1650 or in 1667 according to different sources . Jan Anthonie had a brother , Jan Michiel , who also became a painter and with whom he is sometimes confused . Jan Anthonie studied with his father as well as with the prominent painter Charles Emmanuel Biset . Charles Emmanuel Biset was the brother of Jeanne Biset ( Jan Anthonie’s mother ) and director of the Academy of Antwerp . Jan Anthonie commenced his career in Mechelen around the year 1691 . That year he was commissioned by the city of Mechelen to make a portrait of Charles II of Spain , the last Habsburg ruler of Spain and also ruler of the Southern Netherlands . In 1698 he painted the figures in a landscape made by Jacques dArthois for the St . James Church in Bruges . From 1699 onwards he is recorded in Amsterdam . In 1703 he became poorter of Amsterdam . Wybrand de Geest ( II ) was his pupil . De Geest published in 1702 a book with engravings of Antique sculptures under the title Het Kabinet der Statuen ons van d’Aloudheid Nagelaten , which he dedicated to his master and friend Coxie . It is believed that Jan Anthonie Coxie is the Coxie that the early Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken claimed had painted the grisaille representations of the liberal arts on the panels that covered a tryptich made by Gerard Dou . This tryptich was in the collection of William I of the Netherlands , but is now lost although a copy by Willem Joseph Laquy exists . The grisaille paintings by Coxie made clear that the three paintings by Gerard Dou , which depicted genre scenes , were in fact allegories of the liberal arts . Although successful as testified by the praises sung of his work by local poets Sybrand Feitama and François Halma , he left Amsterdam and is recorded in Berlin from 1705 to 1708 . He became the court painter of Frederick I of Prussia and decorated the ceilings of Charlottenburg Palace , the Berlin Palace and other residences of Frederick I with allegorical scenes praising the deeds of the king . He painted the walls and an altarpiece in the Chapel at Charlottenburg Palace . After the death of his patron , Coxie left Berlin for Mainz in 1713 . Here he worked for the court . He did not stay in Mainz for long but moved around 1713 to Milan . He was known in Italy as Monsù Coixe . He would remain active in Lombardia until his death , probably in Milan , in 1720 . Work . He painted portraits as well as historical and allegorical paintings . His style is regarded as following that of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck . Whilst in Italy he produced copies after the work of these two leading Flemish Baroque artists . He was regarded as a capable draughtsman . One of his masterpieces produced during his early career in Flanders is the large Group Portrait of the FaydHerbe Family in an Architectural Setting ( in a private collection ) of 1693 . From his Amsterdam period , mainly portraits of prominent personalities such as the Portrait of Nicolaas van der Meer ( Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht ) and the Portrait of Antoni de Mestral ( Bredas Museum ) have been preserved . Of the works from his Berlin period , the ceiling frescos he painted for the porcelain room in the Charlottenburg Palace are his best known . The frescos can be regarded as propaganda for the glorious rule of Frederick I . They represent Aurora , the Goddess of Dawn , in her seven-horsed chariot chasing away Night and clearing the way for the Sun-God Apollo , who approaches in his chariot in a blaze of light . Hovering overhead , Mercury heralds the arrival of the life-giving god and Saturn ushers in the Golden Age with his scythe . He also included images of the Four Continents as well as the Four Seasons , which are familiar allusions to political power and thus affirm the greatness of Frederick I .</p><p>question: What was the working location for Jan Anthonie Coxie from 1713 to 1720?</p><p>pred: Milan</p><p>context_time: Jan Anthonie Coxie or Anthonie Coxie ( c . 1660 - 1720 ) was a Flemish painter and draughtsman mainly known for his portrait and history paintings .

She is married to former media proprietor Conrad Black . Early life and career . Amiel was born into a Jewish family in Watford , Hertfordshire , England , the daughter of Vera Isserles ( née Barnett ) and Harold Joffre Amiel . A cousin was the oncologist , broadcaster and humorist Rob Buckman . Her father , originally a solicitor , became a Lieutenant Colonel serving in Italy during World War 2 , but was discharged because of injury . Her parents divorced when she was eight , after her father left her mother for another woman . Amiel attended North London Collegiate School in Edgware , Greater London , an independent girls school . Amiels mother remarried and , in November 1952 , the couple emigrated with Barbara , her sister and half-brother , to Hamilton , Ontario . She never saw her biological father again after her mother remarried . Family difficulties , including a period when her step-father was unemployed , precipitated her living independently for periods of time from the age of 14 during which she gained employment to support herself . My mother loathed me and saw me as a hindrance to her life , she told Alice Thomson of The Times in 2020 . Her natural father took his own life in 1956 after the discovery of theft from his clients . Amiels family decided not to disclose this information ; she did not discover the truth for three years . In 1959 , she entered the University of Toronto , and took a degree in Philosophy and English . Amiel was then sympathetic to communism , and was a delegate in 1962 to the Soviet-organised World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki , Finland . In the late 1960s , Amiel was a story editor and , for a brief period , a presenter for CBC TV Public Affairs . In the 1970s she was intermittently on contract with both CTV and TV Ontario and was a regular on the CBC TVs midday Bob McLean Show . Amiel first joined Macleans magazine in 1976 working as a senior writer , associate editor and columnist . By Persons Unknown : The Strange Death of Christine Demeter ( 1977 , co-authored with her second husband ) , won The Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for Best non-fiction in 1978 . She served as the first female editor of the Toronto Sun from 1983 until 1985 . Marriages . Amiel has been married four times , with three marriages ending in divorce . She entered a brief marriage to Gary Smith in 1964 . Her second marriage was to poet , broadcaster and author George Jonas from 1974 to 1979 . Her political orientation switched from left to right during her marriage to Jonas , a process which is described in Confessions , her 1980 memoir . A third marriage in 1984 was to cable businessman David Graham , but the couple split around 1988 , eventually divorcing in 1990 . The publisher Lord Weidenfeld became Amiels friend and , for a time , her lover . On 21 July 1992 , she married Conrad Black , a Canadian businessman with extensive mining and media interests . According to Tom Bower , Blacks goals in life vastly expanded after his marriage to Amiel . Peter Oborne described them as Londons most glamorous power couple during the 1990s in a 2004 Spectator article . In 2001 , Amiel became Lady Black after her husband gained a life peerage as Lord Black of Crossharbour . Career in British journalism . After her return to London , from 1986 to 1999 , Amiel was a columnist for The Times and , from 1991 , a senior political columnist for The Sunday Times . In 1995 , she moved to The Daily Telegraph , then owned by Conrad Blacks company . In December 2001 , she alleged in The Spectator magazine that coarse and reputedly antisemitic remarks had been uttered by the ambassador of a major EU country at a party she hosted . The Times of London identified the individual as then-French ambassador to the UK , Daniel Bernard . Amiel said he had described Israel as that shitty little country . Bernard , via a spokesman , did not deny making the comment . Amiels journalism became known , according to Andy McSmith in 2007 , for her ferocious defence of Israel and as an opponent of the BBC . She wrote in September 2003 that while it is too late to kill Arafat , the conflict in the Middle East is not amenable to a peaceful solution and can only be solved by the total victory of one side either by the Arabs annihilating the Israelis or the Israelis being forced to use every means , not excluding nuclear power , to defend themselves . She was accused in 2002 by Sir Peregrine Worsthorne , former editor of The Sunday Telegraph , of writing enragingly narrow-minded and logic-choppingly unpersuasive apologies for Israel . After Amiel lost her Daily Telegraph column in May 2004 , Worsthorne described her , of all Blacks neo-conservative columnists , as the worst of the lot . In a July 2003 , Daily Telegraph article , she wrote that the BBC had been a bad joke in its news and public affairs broadcasting for several decades with its relentless anti-Israel and anti-America biases . A few months earlier , in a March 26 Telegraph article , she said that the BBC Arabic Service had never analysed the power structures inside Iraq and how it merged into the interests of Saddam Husseins family . The head of the World Service , Mark Byford , said the Arabic Service had covered these issues with countless interviews and debates . In a Telegraph article published on 3 March 2003 , she compared the BBCs Arabic Service to the controlled press in Arabic dictatorships who are not allowed to publish any criticisms of their governments . Amiel was criticized in 2004 by William Dalrymple in the New Statesman for writing articles that portray Arabs and Islam in a derogatory manner . In an early 2004 Telegraph article , Amiel made claims which greatly overestimated Muslim demographics in France and its potential growth , asserting it was not impossible for a majority of the French population to be Muslims by the end of the 2020s . Michèle Tribalat , a demographer at Institut national détudes démographiques ( INED ) said the figures Amiel suggested were une sottise ( a piece of foolishness ) . Nick Cohen , in a January 2002 New Statesman article , accused Amiel of being one of the people who believe objectively the anti-American is pro-Bin Laden . She had responded to a speech the dramatist Harold Pinter had delivered on 10 September 2001 calling for opposition to American foreign policies . According to Amiel , comments by Pinter on these lines had long been an incitement to violence . No amount of bons mots can quite distance him morally from what took place the next day , meaning the September 11 attacks . Duff McDonald in Vanity Fair wrote that her fiery prose makes Ann Coulters seem tame in comparison . According to McDonald , Amiel has used her outlets to defend nonviolent sexual harassment of the kind Anita Hill said she had endured from ( then ) Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas , to describe homosexuality as abominable , and to describe as horrifying the Princess of Wales sympathy for AIDS sufferers . In 2005 , she rejoined Macleans as a columnist under its new editor , Kenneth Whyte . Hollinger expenses . In 2002 , Amiel gave an interview to Vogue magazine which led to an enquiry into Hollingers accounts led by Gordon Paris . Amiel was then Vice-President : Editorial of Hollinger Inc. ; her husband was then president and CEO . In her London home , she told Vogue her extravagance knows no bounds . She displayed a fur closet , a sweater closet , .. . and a closet so crammed with evening gowns that the overflow has to be kept in yet more closets downstairs . There were a dozen Hermes Birkin bags , at least thirty handbags made by Renaud Pellegrino and over 100 pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes each costing between £250 and £800 . Amiels excesses also extended to a large collection of jewellery . It is always best to have two planes , because however well one plans ahead , one always finds one is on the wrong continent , she said . Only a few hundred women in the world can afford to dress like Mrs . Black , wrote Margaret Wente in a November 2003 issue of Torontos Globe and Mail , and Mrs . Black may not be among them . After the Vogue interview , Hollinger International began legal action in Illinois against the couple and other executives , seeking $1.25 billion in damages . The lifestyle that Lord and Lady Black of Crossharbour enjoyed was charged to Hollinger expenses . A court filing by Hollinger in the Chicago Court at the end of August 2004 said Amiel had been paid $6.7 million in salary , bonuses and fees by the company during the seven years she was vice-president whose indicated tasks were nothing more than euphemisms for ordinary activities . Between 1998 and 2003 , Amiel served as a columnist at her husbands Chicago Sun-Times and earned $1.3 million for a limited number of articles . A biography of the couple by Tom Bower , , was published in November 2006 . According to Bower , Black wanted to appear as a billionaire , and Amiel was an eager accomplice to his desire . She could have discovered that her husbands income was insufficient to finance their ambitions , but she preferred not to investigate . Black denounced the book in The Sunday Telegraph finding disgusting Bowers key-hole , smut-mongering side-piece portrayal of Amiel . Black filed a suit in Canada against Bower in February 2007 , claiming that the biography described Amiel as grasping , hectoring , slatternly , extravagant , shrill and a harridan . At the time of Blacks release from prison in 2012 the case was described as a $2.5-million suit and Bower said How can a convicted fraudster find a jury who will say that his reputation has been damaged by a book that says hes a fraudster ? Blacks trial and conviction . Amiel accompanied Black to his trial in a Chicago courtroom , which lasted for 15 weeks , ending with convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice on 13 July 2007 . Lord Black of Crossharbour was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment in December 2007 . Amiel was reported to have lost her self control in court early in the trial , and to have spoken in anger to a handful of female journalists who gained her displeasure . In August 2008 , Macleans magazine published Amiels defence of her husband ( also published in The Sunday Times ) , in which she portrayed herself as the victim of a gross injustice . My life was wiped out in Chicago at least all that mattered in it , she wrote . What does it matter if one well-off elderly white woman with too many pairs of expensive shoes now finds her social life largely limited to visiting her dearly missed husband in a U.S . federal correctional institution . Accompanied by his wife , Black had reported to Coleman Correctional Facility in Florida on 3 March 2008 to serve his sentence . In the Macleans article , Amiel believed her husbands experience demonstrated gross defects in the American judicial system : If ostensibly privileged defendants like us can be baselessly smeared , wrongfully deprived , falsely accused , shamelessly persecuted , innocently convicted and grotesquely punished , it doesnt take much to figure out what happens to the vulnerable , the powerless , the working-class people whose savings have been eaten up trying to defend themselves . Roy Greenslade wrote that Amiel misrepresented the case of the prosecution in her Sunday Times article and , like her husband , was in denial . Black was released from Florida Penitentiary , in the United States on 4 May 2012 . He received a full pardon from President Donald Trump in May 2019 . Amiels memoir , Friends and Enemies : A Memoir , was published in October 2020 . Of those who severed contact with her after her husband lost control of Hollinger , she comments : the only revenge would be to see our persecutors guillotined . I have worked out 1,001 ways to see them die , beginning with injecting them with the ebola virus and watching . Sarah Sands , in a review for The Spectator , describes it as more of an operatic reckoning than a memoir . Amiel pre-empts criticism . Is she a femme fatale ? Of course she is .

Description . In the painting , Monet depicts Camille in a padded , heavily decorated red kimono ( an ) belonging to a famous Japanese actor , standing on Japanese-style tatami mat and in front of a wall decorated by Japanese fans . Camille , whose hair was dark , wears a blonde wig , emphasizing her identity as a European woman , indicating that the painting shows the performance and appropriation of Japanese culture rather than an authentic Japanese environment . Camilles body , turned in profile , shows her face turned towards the viewer , a gesture likely inspired by gestures found in traditional Japanese dance ; illustrations depicting Japanese dance , such as Charles Wirgmans A Japanese dinner party , were popular in Europe at the time , and would likely have been available for Monet to draw inspiration from . Monet places particular importance in the depiction of the detailed samurai embroidery on Camilles robe , positioning the face of the samurai in the near centre of the canvas . The depiction of the samurai , with dark hair , a stern facial expression and a strong grip on the sword in his belt , contrast Camille - with blonde hair , holding a fan delicately and smiling - strongly , drawing attention again to the difference between the Japanese setting and the European woman within it . Camilles raised right hand holds a folding fan in the colours of the French flag , which also appeared in one of Renoirs paintings . The contrast between Camille and the paintings faux-cultural setting is increased further by a backdrop of fans . Though most depict only hazy Impresssionist landscapes , with one on the left showing a red-crowned crane , a fan to the right of Camilles raised right hand shows a Japanese woman wearing a kimono and a traditional hairstyle , depicted on a rosy red background . Separated from the others with a contrasting background , it draws attention as the womans face tilts in the opposite direction to Camilles , echoing the other . While Camille looks out at the viewer with a smile , the woman in the fan shows an almost astonished facial expression looking at her European counterpart . Motivation . Money became one of Monets biggest troubles in the 1860s . His father had cut his allowance due to Monets rebellious decision to create works unsuitable for the state-sponsored Salon exhibitions . Although Monets financial condition improved in the early 1870s after his works were recognized and regularly purchased by art dealer , this support began to erode due to s difficulty in selling them ; due to the loss of this important source of income and the expenses Monet faced in moving into a new house , beginning in 1874 , he began to fall back into financial difficulty . In desperate need of money , Monet created this painting of his wife in a red kimono that he borrowed from a friend , and sent the painting to s gallery in the second Impressionism exhibition of 1876 , along with 18 other paintings , including the famous Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son . Given the popularity of Japonisme in France at this time , Monet hoped to sell at a high price to ease his financial difficulties . Forty years later , in 1918 , when the art dealers and visited Monet and informed him that had sold for a very decent price , Monet was said to stated that he was ashamed by the fact of having painted the work simply to please the market , calling it a piece of filth . Some scholars believe that he may have been more committed to this subject than these comments would suggest ; when the work was in progress , Monet wrote to Philippe Burty , a famous art critic and collector of Japanese artworks , commenting that it was superb to paint the heavily detailed kimono . Other scholars argue that this letter may have been an advertisement instead of Monets true words , and motivated by a desire to influence notable critics who held an interest in such as Burty . Another possible motivation for the creation of this painting is that Monet wished to compete with his friend s work The Lady with the Fans , modeled by in 1873 . There is no solid evidence that Monet had seen this work in person before he painted the , but he seemed to know of it from an engraving of s sketch of the work , published in the book in February 1874 . A 1876 review in the journal even described Monets works as following suit . Criticism . After being exhibited in the second Impressionism exhibition in 1876 , the painting received attention , though not always positive , from art critics . Critics and praised the work for its innovation and bold use of colors , but many critics described the work as bizarre and sexually suggestive . The critic wrote in his review : He has shown a Chinese in a red robe with two heads , one is that of a demi-mondaine placed on the shoulders , the other that of a monster , placed we dare not say where . Other writers pointed out the placement of the samurais head on the robe as being suggestive , coupled with the depiction of unshesthing his sword . Camilles coquettish facial expression was also said to be part of the erotic symbolism . The criticism seemed to embarrass Monet , who likely withdrew the work from the exhibition before its end to prevent public viewing , though he claimed the work had been purchased by a secret buyer at the unbelievably high price of 2,020 francs . Many art historians have questioned the authenticity of this record-breaking price , with a variety of different explanations . Some believe that it was a publicity stunt played by Monet and ; that bought it at a high price and Monet secretly repurchased it back . Another art historian believes that the purchase was a face-saving fable to move the public attention away from the embarrassing criticism . The hypothesis that the unprecedentedly high price was not real offers an explanation for the content in a letter from Monet to his friend , in which the painting was mentioned . Monet wrote:I would be very obliged to you if you would not repeat to anyone what I told you on the subject of . I have promised to keep it quiet , it would inconvenience me . I count , then , on your discretion and , in case you may already have dropped a word to , recommend to him the most complete silence , otherwise , there would be endless gossip and annoyances for me . It is possible that Monet had informed of his trick , and that he had warned him not to tell anyone else , or that Monet wanted to hide from the public the painting Camille had modeled for , given the criticism of the paintings sexually suggestive nature , though no one mentioned Camilles name in connection with the work until Monet revealed her role to and in 1918 , the blond wig having disguised her identity until this point . Kimono Wednesday controversy . In 2015 , the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston held a special program called Kimono Wednesdays in which visitors were invited to pose in front of while wearing a replica of the kimono in the painting . The kimono , made in Kyoto , was offered by NHK , the Japanese cosponsor of the initiative . The kimono was first exhibited in several Japanese cities , and visitors to the exhibition were invited to pose for photos wearing the kimono . The MFA brought the kimono to Boston and continued the activities that had taken place in Japan . The event drew criticism from protesters , who described the program as an example of Orientalism and white supremacy , accusing the museum of having insufficiently [ grappled ] with [ the painting’s ] post-colonial legacy . As part of the protest , a Tumblr blog titled Decolonize Our Museums criticized the Kimono Wednesday event as a form of cultural appropriation , and described it as enacted by a historically white institution that retains the power to represent—and therefore dominate—other ethnic and cultural groups . Although the museum stopped allowing visitors to wear the kimono in response to the criticisms , the program was defended by some , with Japans deputy consul general telling the press that the protest did not make sense from a Japanese perspective . Japanese counter-protesters led by Timothy visited the exhibition wearing their own kimono after the MFA stopped allowing visitors to pose wearing the replica , arguing that kimono could be enjoyed by people of all ethnicities , not only the Japanese . Meiji University professor Shaun O’Dwyer also defended the program , citing his concern of the shrinking nature of the traditional kimono making industry , and the need of any possible publicity for its survival . Monet chose the subject of partially for its popularity in the Parisian art market in the 1870s , with his later works reflecting a deeper level of understanding and application of Japanese aesthetics , compared to the comparatively surface-level depiction shown in .

The depiction of the samurai , with dark hair , a stern facial expression and a strong grip on the sword in his belt , contrast Camille - with blonde hair , holding a fan delicately and smiling - strongly , drawing attention again to the difference between the Japanese setting and the European woman within it . Camilles raised right hand holds a folding fan in the colours of the French flag , which also appeared in one of Renoirs paintings . The contrast between Camille and the paintings faux-cultural setting is increased further by a backdrop of fans . Though most depict only hazy Impresssionist landscapes , with one on the left showing a red-crowned crane , a fan to the right of Camilles raised right hand shows a Japanese woman wearing a kimono and a traditional hairstyle , depicted on a rosy red background . Separated from the others with a contrasting background , it draws attention as the womans face tilts in the opposite direction to Camilles , echoing the other . While Camille looks out at the viewer with a smile , the woman in the fan shows an almost astonished facial expression looking at her European counterpart . Motivation . Money became one of Monets biggest troubles in the 1860s . His father had cut his allowance due to Monets rebellious decision to create works unsuitable for the state-sponsored Salon exhibitions . Although Monets financial condition improved in the early 1870s after his works were recognized and regularly purchased by art dealer , this support began to erode due to s difficulty in selling them ; due to the loss of this important source of income and the expenses Monet faced in moving into a new house , beginning in 1874 , he began to fall back into financial difficulty . In desperate need of money , Monet created this painting of his wife in a red kimono that he borrowed from a friend , and sent the painting to s gallery in the second Impressionism exhibition of 1876 , along with 18 other paintings , including the famous Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son . Given the popularity of Japonisme in France at this time , Monet hoped to sell at a high price to ease his financial difficulties . Forty years later , in 1918 , when the art dealers and visited Monet and informed him that had sold for a very decent price , Monet was said to stated that he was ashamed by the fact of having painted the work simply to please the market , calling it a piece of filth . Some scholars believe that he may have been more committed to this subject than these comments would suggest ; when the work was in progress , Monet wrote to Philippe Burty , a famous art critic and collector of Japanese artworks , commenting that it was superb to paint the heavily detailed kimono . Other scholars argue that this letter may have been an advertisement instead of Monets true words , and motivated by a desire to influence notable critics who held an interest in such as Burty . Another possible motivation for the creation of this painting is that Monet wished to compete with his friend s work The Lady with the Fans , modeled by in 1873 . There is no solid evidence that Monet had seen this work in person before he painted the , but he seemed to know of it from an engraving of s sketch of the work , published in the book in February 1874 . A 1876 review in the journal even described Monets works as following suit . Criticism . After being exhibited in the second Impressionism exhibition in 1876 , the painting received attention , though not always positive , from art critics . Critics and praised the work for its innovation and bold use of colors , but many critics described the work as bizarre and sexually suggestive . The critic wrote in his review : He has shown a Chinese in a red robe with two heads , one is that of a demi-mondaine placed on the shoulders , the other that of a monster , placed we dare not say where . Other writers pointed out the placement of the samurais head on the robe as being suggestive , coupled with the depiction of unshesthing his sword . Camilles coquettish facial expression was also said to be part of the erotic symbolism . The criticism seemed to embarrass Monet , who likely withdrew the work from the exhibition before its end to prevent public viewing , though he claimed the work had been purchased by a secret buyer at the unbelievably high price of 2,020 francs . Many art historians have questioned the authenticity of this record-breaking price , with a variety of different explanations . Some believe that it was a publicity stunt played by Monet and ; that bought it at a high price and Monet secretly repurchased it back . Another art historian believes that the purchase was a face-saving fable to move the public attention away from the embarrassing criticism . The hypothesis that the unprecedentedly high price was not real offers an explanation for the content in a letter from Monet to his friend , in which the painting was mentioned . Monet wrote:I would be very obliged to you if you would not repeat to anyone what I told you on the subject of . I have promised to keep it quiet , it would inconvenience me . I count , then , on your discretion and , in case you may already have dropped a word to , recommend to him the most complete silence , otherwise , there would be endless gossip and annoyances for me . It is possible that Monet had informed of his trick , and that he had warned him not to tell anyone else , or that Monet wanted to hide from the public the painting Camille had modeled for , given the criticism of the paintings sexually suggestive nature , though no one mentioned Camilles name in connection with the work until Monet revealed her role to and in 1918 , the blond wig having disguised her identity until this point . Kimono Wednesday controversy . In 2015 , the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston held a special program called Kimono Wednesdays in which visitors were invited to pose in front of while wearing a replica of the kimono in the painting . The kimono , made in Kyoto , was offered by NHK , the Japanese cosponsor of the initiative . The kimono was first exhibited in several Japanese cities , and visitors to the exhibition were invited to pose for photos wearing the kimono . The MFA brought the kimono to Boston and continued the activities that had taken place in Japan . The event drew criticism from protesters , who described the program as an example of Orientalism and white supremacy , accusing the museum of having insufficiently [ grappled ] with [ the painting’s ] post-colonial legacy . As part of the protest , a Tumblr blog titled Decolonize Our Museums criticized the Kimono Wednesday event as a form of cultural appropriation , and described it as enacted by a historically white institution that retains the power to represent—and therefore dominate—other ethnic and cultural groups . Although the museum stopped allowing visitors to wear the kimono in response to the criticisms , the program was defended by some , with Japans deputy consul general telling the press that the protest did not make sense from a Japanese perspective . Japanese counter-protesters led by Timothy visited the exhibition wearing their own kimono after the MFA stopped allowing visitors to pose wearing the replica , arguing that kimono could be enjoyed by people of all ethnicities , not only the Japanese . Meiji University professor Shaun O’Dwyer also defended the program , citing his concern of the shrinking nature of the traditional kimono making industry , and the need of any possible publicity for its survival . Monet chose the subject of partially for its popularity in the Parisian art market in the 1870s , with his later works reflecting a deeper level of understanding and application of Japanese aesthetics , compared to the comparatively surface-level depiction shown in .

She earned a PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ( UNC-Chapel Hill ) in 2014 . Appointed to the VRC in 2014 , she is currently the scientific lead of the VRCs Coronavirus Team , with research efforts aimed at propelling novel coronavirus vaccines , including a COVID-19 vaccine . In December 2020 , the Institutes Director , Dr . Anthony Fauci said : Kizzy is an African American scientist who is right at the forefront of the development of the vaccine . In February 2021 , Corbett was highlighted in the Times Time100 Next list under the category of Innovators , with a profile written by Dr . Fauci . In the Times profile , Dr . Fauci wrote that Corbett has been central to the development of the Moderna mRNA vaccine and the Eli Lilly therapeutic monoclonal antibody that were first to enter clinical trials in the U.S . and that her work will have a substantial impact on ending the worst respiratory-disease pandemic in more than 100 years . Early life and education . Corbett was born in Hurdle Mills , North Carolina 1986 , to Rhonda Brooks . She grew up in Hillsborough , North Carolina , where she had a large family of step-siblings and foster siblings . Corbett went to Oak Lane Elementary School in Roxboro NC and A.L . Stanback Middle School . Her fourth grade teacher , Myrtis Bradsher , recalls recognizing Corbetts talent at an early age and encouraging Kizzys mother to place her in advanced classes . I always thought she is going to do something one day . She dotted is and crossed ts . The best in my 30 years of teaching , Bradsher said in a 2020 interview with The Washington Post . In 2004 , Corbett graduated from Orange High School in Hillsborough , North Carolina . In 2008 , Corbett received a B.S . in biological sciences and sociology from the University of Maryland , Baltimore County ( UMBC ) , as a student in the Meyerhoff Scholars Program . Corbett is among a cohort of recent UMBC graduates ( also including Kaitlyn Sadtler ) who have risen to prominence in biomedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic . In 2014 , Corbett received a PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . For her doctoral work , Corbett worked in Sri Lanka to study the role of human antibodies in dengue virus pathogenesis . Career . While in high school , Corbett realized that she wanted to pursue a scientific career , and as part of a program called ProjectSEED , spent her summer holiday working in research laboratories , one of which was at UNCs Kenan Labs with organic chemist James Morkin . In 2005 , she was a summer intern at Stony Brook University in Gloria Vibouds lab where she studied Yersinia pseudotuberculosis pathogenesis . From 2006 to 2007 , she worked as a lab tech in Susan Dorseys lab at the University of Maryland School of Nursing . After earning her bachelors degree , from 2006 to 2009 , Corbett was a biological sciences trainer at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , where she worked alongside Dr . Barney S . Graham . At the NIH , Corbett worked on the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus as well as on a project focused on innovative vaccine platform advancement . From 2009 to 2014 , Corbett studied human antibody responses to dengue virus in Sri Lankan children under the supervision of Aravinda de Silva at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ( UNC-Chapel Hill ) . She studied how people produce antibodies in response to dengue fever , and how the genetics of dengue fever impact the severity of a disease . From April to May 2014 , as part of her research for her dissertation , Corbett worked as a visiting scholar at Genetech Research Institute in Colombo , Sri Lanka . In October 2014 , Corbett became a research fellow working as a viral immunologist at the NIH . Her research aims to uncover mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and host immunity . She specifically focuses on development of novel vaccines for coronaviridae . Her early research considered the development of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) vaccine antigens . During this time , she identified a simple way to make spike proteins that are stabilized in a conformation that renders them more immunogenic and manufacturable , in collaboration with researchers at Scripps Research Institute and Dartmouth College . Development of COVID-19 vaccine . At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic , Corbett started working on a vaccine to protect people from coronavirus disease . Recognizing that the virus was similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus , Corbetts team utilized previous knowledge of optimal coronavirus S proteins to tackle the novel coronavirus . S proteins form a “crown” on the surface of coronaviruses and are crucial for engagement of host cell receptors and the initiation of membrane fusion in coronavirus disease . This makes them a particularly vulnerable target for coronavirus prophylactics and therapeutics . Based on her previous research , Corbetts team , in collaboration with Jason McLellan and other investigators at The University of Texas at Austin , transplanted stabilizing mutations from SARS-CoV S protein into SARS-CoV-2 spike protein . She was part of the NIH team who helped solve the cryogenic electron microscopy ( CryoEM ) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein . Her prior research suggested that messenger RNA ( mRNA ) encoding S protein could be used to excite the immune response to produce protective antibodies against coronavirus disease 2019 . To manufacture and test the COVID-19 vaccine Corbetts team partnered with Moderna , a biotechnology company , to rapidly enter animal studies . Subsequently , the vaccine entered Phase 1 clinical trial only 66 days after the virus sequence was released . The trial , to be completed in at least 45 people , is a dose escalation study in the form of two injections separated by 28 days . Corbetts work afforded her the opportunity to be a part of the National Institutes of Health team that had Donald Trump at the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center in March 2020 . Corbett has called for the public to be cautious and respectful of one another during the coronavirus pandemic , explaining that regular hand washing and sneezing into ones elbow can help to minimize the spread of the virus . She has also emphasized that we should not stigmatize people who may be from areas where the virus started . When asked about her involvement with the development of the COVID-19 vaccine , Corbett said , To be living in this moment where I have the opportunity to work on something that has imminent global importance…its just a surreal moment for me . Corbett stated she cried when the efficacy results showed the mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccine worked . Corbett has worked to rebuild trust with vaccine hesitant populations such as the Black community . For example , she presented education about the COVID-19 vaccine development to Black Health Matters in October 2020 . Her race has been a focus of government outreach ; after a study released by the NAACP and others revealed that only 14% of black Americans believe a COVID-19 vaccine will be safe , NIAID Director Fauci was explicit : the first thing you might want to say to my African American brothers and sisters is that the vaccine that youre going to be taking was developed by an African American woman . Academic service . Corbett regularly shares information on Twitter and takes part in programs to inspire youth in underserved communities .

Preston North End . A striker and a product of the Preston North End youth system Nigel made his debut as a seventeen-year-old in a league game away at Lincoln City a game they lost 4–0 . With Preston enduring difficulties both on and off the pitch Greenwood found himself being used no less than 17 times that season scoring 5 goals as the Deepdale club were relegated to the leagues basement division for the first time in their history . The following 1985–86 season PNE were installed as favourites for promotion but they endured the worst season in the clubs history with Preston finishing 91st in the football league and having to endure the stigma of applying for re-election . For Greenwood however the season was a personal triumph with him scoring 10 goals from 36 games indeed as an attacking side Preston were not too bad with duo John Thomas and Gary Brazil both scoring goals regularly . In fact between the three of them almost 50 goals were scored in defence however it was a different matter with the club conceding over 100 goals in all games for the second season running . Transfer . In August 1986 though Greenwood was shocked to learn that Preston were prepared to sell him . Preston didnt want to sell him and Greenwood didnt want to leave but now that John McGrath was at the helm it was decided that funds needed to be made available to pay the signing on fees of the free transfer players he had lined up . Greenwood was considered to be worth £20k the most saleable asset PNE had so with the promise from McGrath that once Preston were in a viable financial position they would bring him back to Deepdale Greenwood signed for third division Bury .

With Preston enduring difficulties both on and off the pitch Greenwood found himself being used no less than 17 times that season scoring 5 goals as the Deepdale club were relegated to the leagues basement division for the first time in their history . The following 1985–86 season PNE were installed as favourites for promotion but they endured the worst season in the clubs history with Preston finishing 91st in the football league and having to endure the stigma of applying for re-election .

Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed , from 1926 , the first feature-length animated film , and Papageno ( 1935 ) . Reiniger is also noted for having devised the first form of a multiplane camera ; she made more than 40 films , all using her invention . Biography . Early life . Lotte Reiniger was born in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin on 2 June 1899 to Carl Reiniger and Eleonore Lina Wilhelmine Rakette . As a child , she was fascinated with the Chinese arts of paper cutting of silhouette puppetry , even building her own puppet theatre so that she could put on shows for her family and friends . As a teenager , Reiniger developed a love of cinema , first with the films of Georges Méliès for their special effects , then the films of the actor and director Paul Wegener , known today for ( 1920 ) . In 1915 , she attended a lecture by Wegener that focused on the fantastic possibilities of animation . Reiniger eventually convinced her parents to allow her to enroll in the acting group to which Wegener belonged , the Theatre of Max Reinhardt . She began by making costumes and props and working backstage . She started making silhouette portraits of the various actors around her , and soon she was making elaborate title cards for Wegeners films , many of which featured her silhouettes . Adulthood and success . In 1918 , Reiniger animated wooden rats and created the animated intertitles for Wegeners Der Rattenfänger von Hameln ( The Pied Piper of Hamelin ) . The success of this work got her admitted into the Institut für Kulturforschung ( Institute for Cultural Research ) , an experimental animation and shortfilm studio . It was here that she met her future creative partner and husband ( from 1921 ) , Carl Koch , as well as other avant-garde artists including Hans Cürlis , Bertolt Brecht , and Berthold Bartosch . The first film Reiniger directed was Das Ornament des verliebten Herzens ( The Ornament of the Enamoured Heart , 1919 ) , a five-minute piece involving two lovers and an ornament that reflects their moods . The film was very well received , and its success opened up many new connections for Reiniger in the animation industry . She made six short films over the next few years , all produced and photographed by her husband , including the fairytale animation Aschenputtel ( 1922 ) . These shorts were interspersed with advertising films ( the Julius Pinschewer advertising agency innovated ad films and sponsored a large number of abstract animators during the Weimar period ) and special effects for various feature films—most famously a silhouette falcon for a dream sequence in Part One of Die Nibelungen by Fritz Lang . During this time , she found herself at the centre of a large group of ambitious German animators , including Bartosch , Hans Richter , Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger . In 1923 , she was approached by Louis Hagen , who had bought a large quantity of raw film stock as an investment to fight the spiraling inflation of the period . He asked her to do a feature-length animated film . There was some difficulty that came with doing this , however . Reiniger is quoted as saying We had to think twice . This was a never heard of thing . Animated films were supposed to make people roar with laughter , and nobody had dared to entertain an audience with them for more than ten minutes . Everybody to whom we talked in the industry about the proposition was horrified . The result was The Adventures of Prince Achmed , completed in 1926 , one of the first animated feature films , with a plot that is a pastiche of stories from One Thousand and One Nights . Although it failed to find a distributor for almost a year , once premiered in Paris ( thanks to the support of Jean Renoir ) , it became a critical and popular success . Because of this delay , however , The Adventures of Prince Achmeds expressionistic style did not quite fit with the realism that was becoming popular in cinema in 1926 . Reiniger uses lines that can almost be called colorful to represent the films exotic locations . Today , The Adventures of Prince Achmed is thought to be one of the oldest surviving feature-length animated films , if not the oldest . It is also considered to be the first avant-garde full-length animated feature . Reiniger , in devising a predecessor to the multiplane camera for certain effects , preceded Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney by a decade . Above her animation table , a camera with a manual shutter was placed in order to achieve this . She placed planes of glass to achieve a layered effect . The setup was then backlit . This camera setup was later invented simultaneously and innovated in cel animation . Reiniger wrote instructions on how to construct her trick-table in her book , Shadow puppets , shadow theatres , and shadow films . In addition to Reinigers silhouette actors , Prince Achmed boasted dream-like backgrounds by Walter Ruttmann ( her partner in the Die Nibelungen sequence ) and Walter Türck , and a symphonic score by Wolfgang Zeller . Additional effects were added by Carl Koch and Berthold Bartosch . Following the success of Prince Achmed , Reiniger was able to make a second feature . Doktor Dolittle und seine Tiere ( Doctor Dolittle and his Animals , 1928 ) was based on the first of the English childrens books by Hugh Lofting . The film tells of the good Doctors voyage to Africa to help heal sick animals . It is currently available only in a television version with new music , voice-over narration and the images playing at too many frames per second . The score of this three-part film was composed by Kurt Weill , Paul Hindemith and Paul Dessau . A year later , Reiniger co-directed her first live-action film with Rochus Gliese , Die Jagd nach dem Glück ( The Pursuit of Happiness , 1929 ) , a tale about a shadow-puppet troupe . The film starred Jean Renoir and Berthold Bartosch and included a 20-minute silhouette performance by Reiniger . Unfortunately , the film was completed just as sound came to Germany and release of the film was delayed until 1930 to dub in voices by different actors—the result being disappointing . Reiniger attempted to make a third animated feature , inspired by Maurice Ravels opera Lenfant et les sortilèges ( The Child and the Bewitched Things , 1925 ) , but was unable to clear all of the individual rights to Ravels music , the libretto ( by the novelist Colette ) , and an unexpected number of copyright holders . When Ravel died in 1937 the clearance became even more complex and Lotte finally abandoned the project , although she had designed sequences and animated some scenes to convince potential backers and the rights-holders . Reiniger worked on several films with British poet , critic , and musician Eric Walter White , who wrote an early book-length essay on her work . Flight from Germany and later life . With the rise of the Nazi Party , Reiniger and Koch decided to emigrate ( both were involved in left-wing politics ) , but found that no other country would give them permanent visas . As a result , the couple spent the years 1933–1944 moving from country to country , staying as long as visas would allow . With the release of sound film , Reiniger and her husband began to work with music in relation to animation . They worked with film-makers Jean Renoir in Paris and Luchino Visconti in Rome . They managed to make 12 films during this period , the best-known being Carmen ( 1933 ) and Papageno ( 1935 ) , both based on popular operas ( Bizets Carmen and Mozarts Die Zauberflöte ) . When World War II commenced they stayed with Visconti in Rome until 1944 , then moved back to Berlin to take care of Reinigers sick mother . Under the rule of Hitler , Reiniger was forced to make propaganda films for Germany . One of these films is called ( The Golden Goose , 1944 ) . She had to work under stringent and limiting conditions to please the German state , which is why some of her work in this time period may appear creatively stifled . In 1949 , Reiniger and Koch moved to London , where she made a few short advertising films for John Grierson and his General Post Office Film Unit ( later to be renamed the Crown Film Unit ) . While she was living in London in the early 1950s she became friends with Freddy Bloom , the chair of the National Deaf Childrens Society and editor of quarterly magazine called TALK , who asked her to design a logo . Reiniger responded by cutting out silhouettes of four children running up a hill . Freddy Bloom was amazed at her skill with the scissors—in a few moments she created about four different silhouettes of the children from black paper . One of them was used as cover design on the magazine TALK from 1956 . The logo was used until the 1990s , when a design company was invited to revamp it . The result was a very minor modification , but this new design was dropped a few years later.&lt;In the early 1950s she was working at Beconsfield studios in Buckinghamshire.&gt; With Louis Hagen Jr . ( the son of Reinigers financier of Prince Achmed in Potsdam ) , they founded Primrose Productions in 1953 and , over the next two years , produced more than a dozen short silhouette films based on Grimms Fairy Tales for the BBC and Telecasting America . Reiniger also provided illustrations for the 1953 book King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table by Roger Lancelyn Green . After a period of seclusion after her husbands death in 1963 , renewed interest in her work resulted in Reinigers return to Germany . She later visited the United States , and began making films again soon after . She made three more films , the last of which , Die vier Jahreszeiten , was completed the year before she died . Reiniger was awarded the of the Deutscher Filmpreis in 1972 ; in 1979 she received the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany . Reiniger died in Dettenhausen , Germany , on 19 June 1981 , just after her 82nd birthday . Art style . Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s , particularly in terms of characters . In the 1920s especially , characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action , while Reinigers characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions . She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations . This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories . The Adventures of Prince Achmed specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality . Reiniger considered animations separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium . Because of this , Reinigers characters are not usually biologically correct , but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism . Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques , Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation . Reinigers figures resemble stop-motion animation in the way that they move . Influence . Reinigers black silhouettes would become a popular aesthetic to reference in films and art . Although all subsequent makers of animated fairy tales could be said to have been influenced by Reiniger , Bruno J . Böttge is probably the one who has made the most explicit references to her work . Disneys Fantasia uses Reinigers style in the beginning of the scene where Mickey Mouse is in the same shot as the live-action musicians , as well as in The Princess and the Frog during the musical number Friends on the Other Side . Disney would also use a multipleplane camera in its own movies , such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , based on the technology that Reiniger originally developed . Starting with the silhouette format in the 1989 television series Ciné si , French animator Michel Ocelot employs many of the techniques created by Reiniger , along with others of his own invention , in his silhouette film Princes et princesses . Bram Stokers Dracula briefly included a silhouetted scene in its opening a homage to early cinema technique like Reinigers . The animated series South Park uses a paper cut-out style reminiscent of Reinigers . Reinigers cut-out animation style was utilized in the credits of the 2004 film Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events . In the 2010 film , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 , animator Ben Hibon used Reinigers style of animation in the short film titled The Tale of the Three Brothers . The animated series Steven Universe paid homage to the style of Reinigers films in the episode The Answer . Legacy . The municipal museum in Tübingen holds much of her original materials and hosts a permanent exhibition , The World in Light and Shadow : Silhouette , shadow theatre , silhouette film . The Filmmuseum Düsseldorf also holds many materials of Lotte Reinigers work , including her animation table , and a part of the permanent exhibition is dedicated to her . Collections relating to her are also held at the BFI National Archive . On June 2 , 2016 , Google celebrated Reinigers 117th birthday with a Google Doodle about her .

It is usually kept in the Musée dOrsay , Paris . History . On a trip to Spain in 1865 , Édouard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Velázquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of Vélazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance . The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , Émile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper LÉvenement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the Éxposition universelle . The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting . The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death . Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 . It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947 , when it was relocated to the Musée du Jeu de Paume . It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983 , the 100th anniversary of the artists death . In 1986 , it was moved to its current home in the Musée dOrsay , the national museum of 19th-century art . It has since traveled in exposition ; for example , in 2017 and 2018 it was on loan to the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum in Abu Dhabi , UAE . Analysis . As with a painting by Velázquez , Manet conceived a shallow depth , where vertical and horizontal planes are barely distinguishable . According to Peter H . Feist , in The Player fife , Manet showed the appeal of the decorative effect of a large single figure , with emphatic contours and placed before a background surface . Against a monochrome background , the figure is boldly highlighted with a reduced palette of colors mostly laid on in a thick impasto which brings forth the very sharp black of the jacket and shoes , along with the red pants , white strap , spats and so on . Thus , the figure stands firm , smooth and alive . Moreover , as in Velázquezs work , Manet also portrayed an anonymous character , a teenage musician of the band of the Imperial Guard of Napoleon III , who was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne , treated like a grandee of Spain . Additional models may have also posed for the figure : the likenesses of both Léon Leenhoff and Victorine Meurent have been seen in the boys face and figure . In Popular Culture . A fictional tale concerning the painting forms the subject of an episode ( Art for Hogans Sake ) of the American television series Hogans Heroes , in which the work is stolen from the Louvre by a Nazi general and returned by the Allied POWs working with the French underground .</p><p>question: Who owned The Fifer from 1894 to 1911?</p><p>pred: Count Isaac de Camondo</p><p>context_time: Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 .

After growing up in Texas , Prosser was educated at Prairie View Normal College , the University of Colorado and the University of Cincinnati . She was killed in a car accident a short time after earning her doctorate . Early life . Prosser was born to Samuel Andrew and Veola Hamilton Beverly in Yoakum , Texas on December 30 , 1897 . Her mother was a homemaker and her father was a waiter . Prosser was the eldest daughter and the second of eleven children . During her youth , there were few educational opportunities for African-Americans , and her family moved many times to seek the best education they could find for their children . To contribute to the household , Prosser started a college fund to support her younger siblings education . Of the eleven children , all graduated from high school and six went on to earn college degrees . Prosser graduated as valedictorian from Yoakum Colored High School in 1912 and then received a degree in teacher training from Prairie View Normal College ( now Prairie View A&amp;M University ) , where she was also valedictorian . Education and career . She returned to Yoakum and taught for a short time at their segregated schools . Then , Prosser became an assistant principal at Clayton Industrial School in Manor , Texas , before accepting a more long-term position at Anderson High School . Throughout her time at Anderson , she taught English and coached for the Interscholastic League , an organization that sponsored events for Black high school students throughout the state . At Anderson High School , she taught English and coached a girls team for spelling competitions . During this period , Prosser met and married Allen Rufus Prosser , who worked as an elevator operator at a department store in Austin , and the two were married in 1916 . Prosser received several awards and embraced the opportunity to continue her education . She went on to receive a masters degree in educational psychology from the University of Colorado . At Colorado , Prosser took several courses that were particularly relevant to her masters thesis whose subject areas include mental tests , tests and measurement , and research methods . Her thesis , The Comparative Reliability of Objective Tests in English Grammar , examined four kinds of English grammar tests ( using the standards proposed by the National Education Association ) . Her four test types included true-false , multiple choice , completion , and matching questions . All tests covered the same subject areas and difficulty levels as well as comparable numbers of factual and reasoning questions . Upon receiving her masters degree , Prosser left Anderson High School in 1927 to accept a position as a faculty member at Tillotson College , a Black college in Austin . At Tillotson , she not only displayed her teaching and leadership skills but truly dedicated herself to the educational and psychological development of Black students . At Tillotson , she was given the opportunity to organize a series of lectures from 1929 to 1930 , which even featured a lecture by George Washington Carver . Overall , Prosser was at Tillotson College from 1921 to 1930 , serving as Dean , Registrar and Professor of Education . [ 6 ] pg . 10 Her influences extended well beyond the classroom walls or administrative offices . Prosser was eventually transferred to another dual teaching and administrative position at Tougaloo College in Tougaloo , Mississippi . Even as Dean and Registrar of Tougaloo College , Prosser accepted the position as Principal of Tougaloo High School . Her career took an important turn when she applied for and was awarded aid from the General Education Board ( established by John D . Rockefeller in 1902 ) . In her application , she noted , I am interested in that type of research which will lead to better teaching in elementary and high schools . She received $1,000 to apply towards another year of graduate studies . finally , she became one of the first Black women to earn a PhD in psychology , graduating from the University of Cincinnati in 1933 . Warren states that , Prosser was mentored closely by her Doctoral adviser and developed a close friendship with them She held positions at many schools , and not only taught , but also became assistant principal . Although racial discrimination was rampant , Prosser continued to accept minimal wages for work that rivaled or exceeded that of her white colleagues . In Prossers case , according to Warren , Although her dissertation research was in psychology , her doctoral mentor and other members of her committee were psychologists , and much of her coursework was in psychology , she is often denied her well-deserved title of psychologist . Prosser died in a car accident in 1934 . Dissertation and other works . Prosser arrived at the University of Cincinnati as a candidate for a PhD in educational psychology in 1931 . She arrived at a time when there was a research program that focused on African Americans in different school environments . The general consensus in the department at this time was that all-black schools with black teachers could best provide the skills black students needed to survive in a society where most faced limited opportunities…segregated schools , by insulating black students from white abuse , were crucial to the formation of black identity and could become unifying community centers . Prossers dissertation , The Non-Academic Development of Negro Children in Mixed and Segregated Schools , became an important text for issues relating to education , reform , social development , racial identity , and other prominent topics related to segregation . It was a companion study to Mary Crowleys 1931 dissertation , A Comparison of the Academic Achievement of Cincinnati Negroes in Segregated and Mixed Schools Prossers interest in the topic grew out of a desire to determine objectively , so far as possible , the degree of truth in the often repeated statement that the Negro child develops superior character traits , more racial self-respect , and a greater concomitants of a well-rounded education when he is placed under the direction of Negro teachers during his formative years . She took Crowleys research a step further by considering the demographics of the student body in the schools as well . The purpose was : ( 1 ) to measure vocational interests , leisure interests , social participation , emotional or neurotic tendencies , social distance , ascendancy-submission , overstatement , introversion-extraversion , and general personality adjustment… , ( 2 ) to ascertain the difference , if any , that exists in these traits , and ( 3 ) to determine whether one of the other of these schools is better fostering growth in personality in so far as it can be determined by the available techniques . Prosser wanted to examine the difference in personality and mental health between black students in mixed and in segregated schools . Her dissertation sought to answer seven main questions . Prosser measured the following questions by giving students surveys on personality and character traits ; the first question was what are the social and cultural backgrounds of the children in the two groups ? Second , what are the occupational and activity interests of the two groups ? Third , to what extent do black children participate in after school activities ? Fourth , what racial attitudes are each group exhibiting ? Fifth , what are the emotional responses of the two groups towards being discriminated against ? Sixth , what is the effect of the school type on the childrens personality ? Lastly , to what degree is aggressiveness and submission fostered in the two groups ( 1933 ) ? In her dissertation , Prosser argues that racial injustices and feelings of isolation have damaging effects on the psyche of Black children . The effects are even more detrimental with the standards of living as it applies to socioeconomic status . Given that her sample size was small ( 64 students ) , Prosser refrained from making absolute suggestions . She argued that school selection should be based on the students personality , as some do well in integrated schools while others benefit from segregated schools . She believed that most Black students receive a more balanced curriculum , affection , support , and family-school consistency in segregated schools . She also noted that segregated schools not only provided job opportunities , but also a more nurturing environment for Black teachers as well as students . Her work was essential in proving the benefit of predominantly black school as well as HBCUs to the black psyche . In 2010 , the Internationals Encyclopedia of Education published an article highlighting the myriad of positive benefits black students receive in these segregated institutions . They supported these institutions as safe spaces for black students to fortify their sense of self amidst the marginalization they face . The significance of Prossers search was that she concluded that race and racism play a role in the development of ones personality . Legacy . Prosser was one of the key figures in the debate on how to best educate Black students . Arguments made in her dissertation were used in the 1920s and 1930s in the debate about school segregation . Her dissertation examined personality differences in black children attending either voluntarily segregated or integrated schools and concluded that black children were better served in segregated schools As a Black female psychologists , Prossers voice was crucial during her time and now because the voices and this histories of Black Psychology and Black Psychologist has been absent from the narratives of mainstream American psychology . Although her dissertation research remains unpublished , her work appropriated by other researchers were used in the debated leading up to the Brown v . Board of Education U.S . Supreme Court ruling of 1954 , which argues that segregated schools were inherently unequal , thereby mandating integration in the nations public schools . Her works on the educational and identity development of Black students were not only influenced by her teaching and administrative experience , but by her only experiences at a colored school in Texas . While Prosser is frequently referred to as the first African-American woman to earn a PhD in Psychology , others believe that Ruth Winifred Howard ( 1900–1997 ) was the first . Those who argue that Howard , earning PhD at the University of Minnesota in 1934 , is the first African-American woman to earn a PhD , hold the view that a psychologist is someone who earned the degree within a psychology department . Prosser posed a powerful argument regarding the effects of racial inequality on the mental health of African-American children . In her dissertation , she discussed optional education avenues , exploring reasons for providing children the opportunity to be educated according to their ability , not their socioeconomic status . She cited examples of psychological stress in students incurred as a result of racial discrepancies and racial isolation . Prosser voiced her support for segregated schools and the reasons they benefited students and staff , and also provided reasons for which this segregation was detrimental to all students and individuals involved . Many were not in support of segregated schools due to the fact that educational institutions were microcosms of the racist society that existed outside the walls of school . Though the topic was highly debated , The Association of Afro-American Educators displayed continued support for segregated schools in decades to come . Like Prosser , they concur that if resources are properly allocated , the benefits of segregated schools are tremendous to the black child psyche . During the debates over school segregation in the 1920s , many of her arguments were cited . She was a critical voice for the African-American community at a time when women academics were scarce . Prossers contributions to the improvement of education for all students can be felt in many policies still being used throughout the teaching community today . In 1934 , she was killed in an automobile accident near Shreveport , Louisiana .

She is the bestselling author alive and the fourth bestselling fiction author of all time , with over 800 million copies sold . She has written 179 books , including over 146 novels . Based in California for most of her career , Steel has produced several books a year , often juggling up to five projects at once . Despite a resounding lack of critical acclaim ( Publishers Weekly ) , all her novels have been bestsellers , including those issued in hardback . Her formula is fairly consistent , often involving rich families facing a crisis , threatened by dark elements such as prison , fraud , blackmail and suicide . Steel has also published childrens fiction and poetry , as well as raising funds for the treatment of mental disorders . Her books have been translated into 43 languages , with 22 adapted for television , including two that have received Golden Globe nominations . Biography . 1947–1965 : Early life . Steel was born Danielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel in New York City to a German father and a Portuguese mother . Her father , John Schulein-Steel , was a German-Jewish immigrant and a descendant of owners of Löwenbräu beer . Her mother , Norma da Camara Stone dos Reis , was the daughter of a Portuguese diplomat . She spent much of her childhood in France , where from an early age she was included in her parents dinner parties , giving her an opportunity to observe the habits and lives of the wealthy and famous . Her parents divorced when she was eight , and she was raised primarily by her father , rarely seeing her mother . Steel started writing stories as a child , and by her late teens had begun writing poetry . Raised Catholic , she thought of becoming a nun during her early years . A 1965 graduate of the Lycée Français de New York , she studied literature design and fashion design , first at Parsons School of Design and then at New York University . 1965–1971 : First marriage and career beginnings . Steel married French-American banker Claude-Eric Lazard in 1965 at age 18 . While a young wife , and still attending New York University , Steel began writing , completing her first manuscript at the age of 19 . After the birth of their daughter Beatrix , Steel worked for a public-relations agency in New York called Supergirls . A client , Ladies Home Journal editor John Mack Carter , encouraged her to focus on writing , having been impressed with her freelance articles . He suggested she write a book , which she did . She later moved to San Francisco , and worked as a copywriter for Grey Advertising . 1972–1981 : First novel , second and third marriages . Her first novel , Going Home , was published in 1972 . The novel contained many of the themes that her writing would become well known for , including a focus on family issues and human relationships . The heroine of Going Home was a divorced single mother . Steel and Lazard divorced in 1974 . While still married to Lazard , Steel met Danny Zugelder while interviewing an inmate in a prison near Lompoc , California , where Zugelder was also incarcerated . He moved in with Steel when he was paroled in June 1973 , but returned to prison in early 1974 on robbery and rape charges . After receiving her divorce from Lazard in 1975 , she married Zugelder in the prison canteen . She divorced him in 1978 , but the relationship spawned Passions Promise and Now and Forever , the two novels that launched her career . Steel married her third husband , William George Toth , the day after her divorce from Zugelder was finalized . She was already eight months pregnant with his child . With the success of her fourth book , The Promise , she became a participant in San Francisco high society while Toth , a former drug addict , was left out . They divorced in March 1981 . 1981–1996 : Fame and fourth marriage . Steel married for the fourth time in 1981 , to vintner John Traina . Traina subsequently adopted Steels son Nick and gave him his family name . Together they had additional five children , Samantha ( April 14 , 1982 ) , Victoria ( September 5 , 1983 ) , Vanessa ( December 18 , 1984 ) , a fashion stylist , Maxx ( February 10 , 1986 ) and Zara ( September 26 , 1987 ) . Coincidentally , beginning with her marriage to Traina in 1981 , Steel has been a near-permanent fixture on The New York Times hardcover and paperback bestsellers lists . In 1989 , she was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for having a book on the New York Times Bestseller List for the most consecutive weeks of any author—381 consecutive weeks at that time . Since her first book was published , every one of her novels has hit bestseller lists in paperback , and each one released in hardback has also been a hardback bestseller . During this time Steel also contributed to her first non-fiction work . Having a Baby was published in 1984 and featured a chapter by Steel about suffering through miscarriage . The same year she also published a book of poetry , Love : Poems . Steel also ventured into childrens fiction , penning a series of 10 illustrated books for young readers . These books , known as the Max and Martha series , aim to help children face real life problems : new baby , new school , loss of loved one , etc . In addition , Steel has authored the Freddie series . These four books address other real life situations : first night away from home , trip to the doctor , etc . Determined to spend as much time as possible with her own children , Steel often wrote at night , making do with only four hours of sleep . Steel is a prolific author , often releasing several books per year . Each book takes 2½ years to complete , so Steel has developed an ability to juggle up to five projects at once , researching one book while outlining another , then writing and editing additional books . Her fear of flying created so many challenges in the early 1980s that she went through an eight-week course based out of the San Francisco airport to overcome her fear . In 1993 , Steel sued a writer who intended to disclose in her book that her son Nick was adopted by her then-current husband John Traina , despite the fact that adoption records are sealed in California . A San Francisco judge made a highly unusual ruling allowing the seal on Nicks adoption to be overturned , although he was still a minor . This order was confirmed by a California Appellate Judge , who ruled that because Steel was famous , her sons adoption did not have the same privacy right , and the book was allowed to be published . The son at the center of the lawsuits , Nicholas Traina , committed suicide in 1997 . Traina was the lead singer of San Francisco punk bands Link 80 and Knowledge . To honor his memory , Steel wrote the nonfiction book His Bright Light , about Nicks life and death . Proceeds of the book , which reached The New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List were used to found the Nick Traina Foundation , which Steel runs , to fund organizations dedicated to treating mental illness . To gain more recognition for childrens mental illnesses , Steel has lobbied for legislation in Washington , and previously held a fundraiser every two years ( known as The Star Ball ) in San Francisco . 1997–present : Fifth marriage and continued success . Steel married for a fifth time , to Silicon Valley financier Thomas James Perkins , but the marriage ended after four years in 2002 . Steel has said that her novel The Klone and I was inspired by a private joke between herself and Perkins . In 2006 , Perkins dedicated his novel Sex and the Single Zillionaire to Steel . After years of near-constant writing , in 2003 Steel opened an art gallery in San Francisco , Steel Gallery , which showed contemporary work and exhibited the paintings and sculptures of emerging artists . The gallery closed in 2007 . She continues to curate shows a few times a year for the Andrea Schwartz Gallery in San Francisco . In 2002 , Steel was decorated by the French government as an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres , for her contributions to world culture . She has additionally received : - Induction into the California Hall of Fame , December 2009 . - Distinguished Service in Mental Health Award ( first time awarded to a non-physician ) from New York Presbyterian Hospital , Department of Psychiatry and Columbia University Medical School and Cornell Medical College , May 2009 . - Outstanding Achievement Award for work with adolescents from Larkin Street Youth Services in San Francisco , May 2003 . - Service to Youth Award for improving the lives of mentally ill adolescents and children from the University of San Francisco Catholic Youth Organization and St . Marys Medical Center , November 1999 . - Outstanding Achievement Award in Mental Health from the California Psychiatric Association - Distinguished Service Award from the American Psychiatric Association In 2006 Steel reached an agreement with Elizabeth Arden to launch a new perfume , Danielle by Danielle Steel . Steels longtime residence was in San Francisco , but she now spends most of her time at a second home in Paris . Despite her public image and varied pursuits , Steel is known to be shy and because of that and her desire to protect her children from the tabloids , she rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances . Her 55-room San Francisco home , Spreckels Mansion , was built in c.1913 as the mansion of sugar tycoon Adolph B . Spreckels . Writing style . Steels novels , often described as formulaic , tend to involve the characters in a crisis which threatens their relationship . Many of her characters are considered over-the-top , making her books seem less realistic . The novels sometimes explore the world of the rich and famous and frequently deal with serious life issues , like illness , death , loss , family crises , and relationships . Also , there are claims that her popular story lines are based from the events of her life , such as having two ex-con ex-husbands and other events that she kept hidden from the public . Despite a reputation among critics for writing fluff , Steel often delves into the less savory aspects of human nature , including incest , suicide , divorce , war , and even the Holocaust . As time has progressed , Steels writing has evolved . Her later heroines tend to be stronger and more authoritative , who , if they do not receive the level of respect and attention they desire from a man , move on to a new life . In recent years Steel has also been willing to take more risks with her plots . Ransom focuses more on suspense than romance , and follows three sets of seemingly unconnected characters as their lives begin to intersect . Toxic Bachelors departs from her usual style by telling the story through the eyes of the three title characters , men who are relationship phobic and ultimately discover their true loves . Steel has been criticized for making her books overly redundant and detailed , explicitly telling the story to readers instead of showing it to them . This sometimes has the effect of making the readers feel like they are on the outside looking in rather than living the story . To avoid comparisons to her previous novels , Steel does not write sequels . Although many of her earliest books were released with initial print runs of 1 million copies , by 2004 her publisher had decreased the number of books initially printed to 650,000 due to the decline in people buying books . However , her fan base was still extremely strong at that time , with Steels books selling out atop charts worldwide . Twenty-two of her books have been adapted for television , including two that have received Golden Globe nominations . One is Jewels , the story of the survival of a woman and her children in World War II Europe , and the familys eventual rebirth as one of the greatest jewelry houses in Europe . Columbia Pictures was the first movie studio to offer for one of her novels , purchasing the rights to The Ghost in 1998 . Steel also reached an agreement with New Line Home Entertainment in 2005 to sell the film rights to 30 of her novels for DVDs . Writing process . Steel spends two to three years on each book , juggling multiple projects at once . According to Steel , once she has an idea for a story her first step is to make notes , which are mostly about the characters . She told The New York Times in 2018 : I make notes for a while before I start work on the outline . The notes are usually more about the characters . I need to know the characters really well before I start — who they are , how they think , how they feel , what has happened to them , how they grew up .

She is the bestselling author alive and the fourth bestselling fiction author of all time , with over 800 million copies sold . She has written 179 books , including over 146 novels . Based in California for most of her career , Steel has produced several books a year , often juggling up to five projects at once . Despite a resounding lack of critical acclaim ( Publishers Weekly ) , all her novels have been bestsellers , including those issued in hardback . Her formula is fairly consistent , often involving rich families facing a crisis , threatened by dark elements such as prison , fraud , blackmail and suicide . Steel has also published childrens fiction and poetry , as well as raising funds for the treatment of mental disorders . Her books have been translated into 43 languages , with 22 adapted for television , including two that have received Golden Globe nominations . Biography . 1947–1965 : Early life . Steel was born Danielle Fernandes Dominique Schuelein-Steel in New York City to a German father and a Portuguese mother . Her father , John Schulein-Steel , was a German-Jewish immigrant and a descendant of owners of Löwenbräu beer . Her mother , Norma da Camara Stone dos Reis , was the daughter of a Portuguese diplomat . She spent much of her childhood in France , where from an early age she was included in her parents dinner parties , giving her an opportunity to observe the habits and lives of the wealthy and famous . Her parents divorced when she was eight , and she was raised primarily by her father , rarely seeing her mother . Steel started writing stories as a child , and by her late teens had begun writing poetry . Raised Catholic , she thought of becoming a nun during her early years . A 1965 graduate of the Lycée Français de New York , she studied literature design and fashion design , first at Parsons School of Design and then at New York University . 1965–1971 : First marriage and career beginnings . Steel married French-American banker Claude-Eric Lazard in 1965 at age 18 . While a young wife , and still attending New York University , Steel began writing , completing her first manuscript at the age of 19 . After the birth of their daughter Beatrix , Steel worked for a public-relations agency in New York called Supergirls . A client , Ladies Home Journal editor John Mack Carter , encouraged her to focus on writing , having been impressed with her freelance articles . He suggested she write a book , which she did . She later moved to San Francisco , and worked as a copywriter for Grey Advertising . 1972–1981 : First novel , second and third marriages . Her first novel , Going Home , was published in 1972 . The novel contained many of the themes that her writing would become well known for , including a focus on family issues and human relationships . The heroine of Going Home was a divorced single mother . Steel and Lazard divorced in 1974 . While still married to Lazard , Steel met Danny Zugelder while interviewing an inmate in a prison near Lompoc , California , where Zugelder was also incarcerated . He moved in with Steel when he was paroled in June 1973 , but returned to prison in early 1974 on robbery and rape charges . After receiving her divorce from Lazard in 1975 , she married Zugelder in the prison canteen . She divorced him in 1978 , but the relationship spawned Passions Promise and Now and Forever , the two novels that launched her career . Steel married her third husband , William George Toth , the day after her divorce from Zugelder was finalized . She was already eight months pregnant with his child . With the success of her fourth book , The Promise , she became a participant in San Francisco high society while Toth , a former drug addict , was left out . They divorced in March 1981 . 1981–1996 : Fame and fourth marriage . Steel married for the fourth time in 1981 , to vintner John Traina . Traina subsequently adopted Steels son Nick and gave him his family name . Together they had additional five children , Samantha ( April 14 , 1982 ) , Victoria ( September 5 , 1983 ) , Vanessa ( December 18 , 1984 ) , a fashion stylist , Maxx ( February 10 , 1986 ) and Zara ( September 26 , 1987 ) . Coincidentally , beginning with her marriage to Traina in 1981 , Steel has been a near-permanent fixture on The New York Times hardcover and paperback bestsellers lists . In 1989 , she was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for having a book on the New York Times Bestseller List for the most consecutive weeks of any author—381 consecutive weeks at that time . Since her first book was published , every one of her novels has hit bestseller lists in paperback , and each one released in hardback has also been a hardback bestseller . During this time Steel also contributed to her first non-fiction work . Having a Baby was published in 1984 and featured a chapter by Steel about suffering through miscarriage . The same year she also published a book of poetry , Love : Poems . Steel also ventured into childrens fiction , penning a series of 10 illustrated books for young readers . These books , known as the Max and Martha series , aim to help children face real life problems : new baby , new school , loss of loved one , etc . In addition , Steel has authored the Freddie series . These four books address other real life situations : first night away from home , trip to the doctor , etc . Determined to spend as much time as possible with her own children , Steel often wrote at night , making do with only four hours of sleep . Steel is a prolific author , often releasing several books per year . Each book takes 2½ years to complete , so Steel has developed an ability to juggle up to five projects at once , researching one book while outlining another , then writing and editing additional books . Her fear of flying created so many challenges in the early 1980s that she went through an eight-week course based out of the San Francisco airport to overcome her fear . In 1993 , Steel sued a writer who intended to disclose in her book that her son Nick was adopted by her then-current husband John Traina , despite the fact that adoption records are sealed in California . A San Francisco judge made a highly unusual ruling allowing the seal on Nicks adoption to be overturned , although he was still a minor . This order was confirmed by a California Appellate Judge , who ruled that because Steel was famous , her sons adoption did not have the same privacy right , and the book was allowed to be published . The son at the center of the lawsuits , Nicholas Traina , committed suicide in 1997 . Traina was the lead singer of San Francisco punk bands Link 80 and Knowledge . To honor his memory , Steel wrote the nonfiction book His Bright Light , about Nicks life and death . Proceeds of the book , which reached The New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller List were used to found the Nick Traina Foundation , which Steel runs , to fund organizations dedicated to treating mental illness . To gain more recognition for childrens mental illnesses , Steel has lobbied for legislation in Washington , and previously held a fundraiser every two years ( known as The Star Ball ) in San Francisco . 1997–present : Fifth marriage and continued success . Steel married for a fifth time , to Silicon Valley financier Thomas James Perkins , but the marriage ended after four years in 2002 . Steel has said that her novel The Klone and I was inspired by a private joke between herself and Perkins . In 2006 , Perkins dedicated his novel Sex and the Single Zillionaire to Steel . After years of near-constant writing , in 2003 Steel opened an art gallery in San Francisco , Steel Gallery , which showed contemporary work and exhibited the paintings and sculptures of emerging artists . The gallery closed in 2007 . She continues to curate shows a few times a year for the Andrea Schwartz Gallery in San Francisco . In 2002 , Steel was decorated by the French government as an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres , for her contributions to world culture . She has additionally received : - Induction into the California Hall of Fame , December 2009 . - Distinguished Service in Mental Health Award ( first time awarded to a non-physician ) from New York Presbyterian Hospital , Department of Psychiatry and Columbia University Medical School and Cornell Medical College , May 2009 . - Outstanding Achievement Award for work with adolescents from Larkin Street Youth Services in San Francisco , May 2003 . - Service to Youth Award for improving the lives of mentally ill adolescents and children from the University of San Francisco Catholic Youth Organization and St . Marys Medical Center , November 1999 . - Outstanding Achievement Award in Mental Health from the California Psychiatric Association - Distinguished Service Award from the American Psychiatric Association In 2006 Steel reached an agreement with Elizabeth Arden to launch a new perfume , Danielle by Danielle Steel . Steels longtime residence was in San Francisco , but she now spends most of her time at a second home in Paris . Despite her public image and varied pursuits , Steel is known to be shy and because of that and her desire to protect her children from the tabloids , she rarely grants interviews or makes public appearances . Her 55-room San Francisco home , Spreckels Mansion , was built in c.1913 as the mansion of sugar tycoon Adolph B . Spreckels . Writing style . Steels novels , often described as formulaic , tend to involve the characters in a crisis which threatens their relationship . Many of her characters are considered over-the-top , making her books seem less realistic . The novels sometimes explore the world of the rich and famous and frequently deal with serious life issues , like illness , death , loss , family crises , and relationships . Also , there are claims that her popular story lines are based from the events of her life , such as having two ex-con ex-husbands and other events that she kept hidden from the public . Despite a reputation among critics for writing fluff , Steel often delves into the less savory aspects of human nature , including incest , suicide , divorce , war , and even the Holocaust . As time has progressed , Steels writing has evolved . Her later heroines tend to be stronger and more authoritative , who , if they do not receive the level of respect and attention they desire from a man , move on to a new life . In recent years Steel has also been willing to take more risks with her plots . Ransom focuses more on suspense than romance , and follows three sets of seemingly unconnected characters as their lives begin to intersect . Toxic Bachelors departs from her usual style by telling the story through the eyes of the three title characters , men who are relationship phobic and ultimately discover their true loves . Steel has been criticized for making her books overly redundant and detailed , explicitly telling the story to readers instead of showing it to them . This sometimes has the effect of making the readers feel like they are on the outside looking in rather than living the story . To avoid comparisons to her previous novels , Steel does not write sequels . Although many of her earliest books were released with initial print runs of 1 million copies , by 2004 her publisher had decreased the number of books initially printed to 650,000 due to the decline in people buying books . However , her fan base was still extremely strong at that time , with Steels books selling out atop charts worldwide . Twenty-two of her books have been adapted for television , including two that have received Golden Globe nominations . One is Jewels , the story of the survival of a woman and her children in World War II Europe , and the familys eventual rebirth as one of the greatest jewelry houses in Europe . Columbia Pictures was the first movie studio to offer for one of her novels , purchasing the rights to The Ghost in 1998 . Steel also reached an agreement with New Line Home Entertainment in 2005 to sell the film rights to 30 of her novels for DVDs . Writing process . Steel spends two to three years on each book , juggling multiple projects at once . According to Steel , once she has an idea for a story her first step is to make notes , which are mostly about the characters . She told The New York Times in 2018 : I make notes for a while before I start work on the outline . The notes are usually more about the characters . I need to know the characters really well before I start — who they are , how they think , how they feel , what has happened to them , how they grew up .

In 1956 Nagy became leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 against the Soviet-backed government , for which he was sentenced to death and executed two years later . Nagy was a committed communist from soon after the Russian Revolution , and through the 1920s he engaged in underground party activity in Hungary . Living in the Soviet Union from 1930 , he served the Soviet NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941 , denouncing over 200 colleagues , who were then purged and arrested and 15 of whom were executed . Nagy returned to Hungary shortly before the end of World War II , and served in various offices as the Hungarian Working Peoples Party ( MDP ) took control of Hungary in the late 1940s and the country entered the Soviet sphere of influence . He played a key role in the ethnic cleansing ( deportation , in this case ) of hundreds of thousands of German-speaking Hungarians from 1945 to 1946 as Interior Minister of Hungary . Nagy became prime minister in 1953 and attempted to relax some of the harshest aspects of Mátyás Rákosis Stalinist regime , but was subverted and eventually forced out of the government in 1955 by Rákosis continuing influence as General Secretary of the MDP . Nagy remained popular with writers , intellectuals , and the common people , who saw him as an icon of reform against the hard-line elements in the Soviet-backed regime . The outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 23 October 1956 saw Nagy elevated to the position of Prime Minister on 24 October as a central demand of the revolutionaries and common people . Nagys reformist faction gained full control of the government , admitted non-communist politicians , dissolved the ÁVH secret police , promised democratic reforms , and unilaterally withdrew Hungary from the Warsaw Pact on 1 November . The Soviet Union launched a massive military invasion of Hungary on 4 November , forcibly deposing Nagy , who fled to the Embassy of Yugoslavia in Budapest . Nagy was lured out of the Embassy under false promises on 22 November , but was arrested and deported to Romania . On 16 June 1958 , Nagy was tried and executed for treason alongside his closest allies , and his body was buried in an unmarked grave . In June 1989 , Nagy and other prominent figures of the 1956 Revolution were rehabilitated and reburied with full honours , an event that played a key role in the collapse of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party regime . Early life and World War I . Imre Nagy was born prematurely on 7 June 1896 in the town of Kaposvár in the Kingdom of Hungary , Austria-Hungary , to a small-town family of peasant origin . His father , József Nagy ( 1869–1929 ) , was a Lutheran and a carriage driver for the lieutenant-general of Somogy county . His mother , Rozália Szabó ( 1877–1969 ) , served as a maid for the lieutenant-generals wife . They both had left the countryside in their youth to work in Kaposvár . Nagy and Szabó married in January 1896 . In 1902 , József became a postal worker and began building a house for the family in 1907 but lost his job in 1911 and had to sell the house . He was an unskilled worker for the rest of his life . In 1904 Nagys family moved to Pécs before returning to Kaposvár the following year . Nagy attended a gymnasium in Kaposvár from 1907 to 1912 , performing poorly . The gymnasium cancelled his tuition due to his lack of accomplishment and funding . He apprenticed as a locksmith in a small metalworking firm in Kaposvár , before moving to a factory for agricultural machinery in Losonc in northern Hungary in 1912 . He returned to Kaposvár in 1913 and was given a journeymans certificate as a metal fitter in 1914 . He abandoned the job in the summer of 1914 and became a clerk at a lawyers office , while simultaneously attending a commercial high school in Kaposvár , where his student performance was good . After the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 , Nagy was called up for military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army in December 1914 and found fit for service . He reported for duty at the 17th Royal Hungarian Honvéd Infantry Regiment in May 1915 , after the end of the school year and before he had graduated . After three months of basic training in Székesfehérvár , his unit was sent to the Italian Front in August 1915 , where he was wounded in his leg at the Third Battle of the Isonzo . After convalescing in a field hospital , he was trained as a machine gunner in the 19th Machine Gun Battalion , promoted to corporal and sent to the Eastern Front in the summer of 1916 . Nagy was wounded in the leg by shrapnel and taken prisoner by the Imperial Russian Army during the Brusilov Offensive in Galicia on 29 July 1916 . After healing his leg wound in a field hospital , he was taken first to Darnitsa , then to Ryazan and finally on a train transport to Siberia . Early political career . In captivity in Camp Berezovka near Lake Baikal in Siberia he participated in a Marxist discussion group until 1917 . In 1918 , he joined the Communist ( Social Democratic ) Party of the Foreign Workers of Siberia , a sub-group of the Russian Communist Party . He fought in the ranks of the Red Army from February to September 1918 during the Russian Civil War . His unit was encircled and he was taken prisoner by the Czechoslovak Legion in early September 1918 . He escaped captivity and spent the period until February 1920 holding odd jobs in White-controlled territory near Lake Baikal . The Red Army reached Irkutsk on 7 February 1920 , ending Nagys participation in the Civil War . On 12 February 1920 he became a candidate member of the Russian Communist Party and a full-time member on 10 May . He served the rest of 1920 as a clerk for the communist Cheka secret police on matters related to prisoners of war . After a month of training by the Cheka in subversive activities , the Hungarian Communist Party ( KMP ) sent Nagy along with 277 other Hungarian communists to Hungary in April 1921 to build up an underground conspiratorial network in a country where the Communist Party had been banned since 1919 . Nagy reached Kaposvár in late May 1921 . Upon arrival , he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary ( MSZDP ) . After working temporary jobs in the rest of 1921 and early 1922 , he joined the First Hungarian Insurance Company and became an office worker in Kaposvár . He became severely overweight around this time . He helped to build up the socialist movement in his hometown , to his parents disapproval . He became secretary of the MSZDPs local branch in 1924 . He was expelled from the party for advocating revolution and was placed under police surveillance . He married Mária Égető on 28 November 1925 . In January 1926 , Nagy and István Sinkovics established the Kaposvár office of the Socialist Workers’ Party of Hungary ( MSZMP ) , a semi-communist left-wing splinter group from the MSZDP . Nagy was successful in gaining 700 voters for the MSZMP Kaposvár parliamentary candidate , one of the partys few successes in the countryside west of Budapest . By this time Nagy had begun to prioritize his interest in agriculture over political leadership and rejected an offer from communist cadres from Vienna to build up the illegal KMP in western Hungary . The MSZMP in Kaposvár was prohibited and Nagy was fired from his insurance job in February 1927 and arrested on 27 February . He was released after two months in prison . While under police surveillance , Nagy found a job as an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company . He was arrested again in December 1927 for three days and was called to Vienna by the KMP , arriving in March 1928 . He became head of the KMPs agrarian section and was sent back to Hungary in September 1928 under a false identity to build up underground communist networks . His efforts were largely a failure , his largest successes being the publishing of three issues of a small journal and his avoidance of arrest . His advocacy of legal political activity over the partys preference for largely impotent clandestine work in villages was dismissed as right-deviancy by the ultra-left KMP leadership . Years in Moscow . In December 1929 , he traveled to the Soviet Union , arriving in Moscow in February 1930 to participate in the KMPs second congress . He rejoined the Communist Party , also becoming a Soviet citizen . He was engaged in agricultural research at the International Agrarian Institute for six years , but also worked in the Hungarian section of the Comintern . He was expelled from the party on 8 January 1936 and worked for the Soviet Statistical Service from the summer of 1936 onward . Under the codename Volodia , Nagy served the NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941 , giving up the names of over 200 comrades , mostly from the Agrarian Institute , who were then arrested and in at least 15 cases executed by the secret police . The NKVD praised him as a qualified agent , who shows great initiative and an ability to approach people . The support that Nagy received from the Soviet leadership after the Second World War was to some extent a result of his loyal service as a foreigner and denouncer to the NKVD . Minister in Communist Hungary . After the Second World War , Nagy returned to Hungary . He was the Minister of Agriculture in the government of Béla Miklós de Dálnok , delegated by the Hungarian Communist Party . He distributed land among the peasant population . In the next government , led by Tildy , he was the Minister of Interior . At this period he played an active role in the expulsion of the Hungarian Germans . In the communist government , he served as Minister of Agriculture and in other posts . He was also Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary from 1947 to 1949 , a largely ceremonial position . In 1951 , he signed , with the rest of the Politburo , the note ordering János Kádárs arrest , resulting in Kádárs torture and sentencing to life in prison after a show trial . After two years as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic ( 1953–1955 ) , during which he promoted his New Course in Socialism , Nagy fell out of favour with the Soviet Politburo . He was deprived of his Hungarian Central Committee , Politburo , and all other Party functions and , on 18 April 1955 , he was sacked as Chairman of the Council of Ministers . 1956 Revolution . Following Nikita Khrushchevs Secret Speech denouncing the crimes of Stalin on 25 February 1956 , dissent began to grow in Eastern Bloc against the ruling Stalinist-era party leaders . In Hungary , Mátyás Rákosi—who self-styled as Stalins greatest disciple—came under increasingly intense criticism for his policies from both the Party and general populace , with more and more prominent voices calling for his resignation . This public criticism often took the form of the Petőfi Circle—a debating club established by the DISZ student youth union to discuss Communist policy—which soon became one of the foremost outlets of dissent against the regime . While Nagy himself never attended a Petőfi Circle meeting , he was kept well informed of events by his close associates Miklós Vásárhelyi and Géza Losonczy , who informed him of the vast popular support expressed for him at the meetings and the widespread desire for his restoration to the leadership . In the face of widespread public pressure on Rákosi , the Soviets forced the unpopular leader to resign from power on 18 July 1956 and leave for the Soviet Union . However , they replaced him with his equally hard-line second in command Ernő Gerő , a change which did little to mollify public dissent . Nagy was a prominent guest at the 6 October reburial of former secret police chief László Rajk , who had been purged by the Rákosi regime and later rehabilitated . He was readmitted to the Party on 13 October in the midst of growing revolutionary fervor . On 22 October , students from the Technical University in Budapest compiled a list of sixteen national policy demands , the third of which was Nagys restoration to the premiership . In the afternoon of 23 October , students and workers gathered in Budapest for a massive opposition demonstration arranged by the Technical University students , chanting—among other things—slogans of support for Imre Nagy . While the ex-premier sympathized with their reformist demands , he was hesitant to support the movement , believing it to be too radical in its demands . While he was in favor of changes to the system , he preferred those to be made within the framework of his New Course of 1953–55 and not a revolutionary upheaval . He also feared that the demonstration was a provocation by Gerő and Hegedüs to frame him as inciting rebellion and to crack down on the opposition . His associates ultimately convinced him to travel to the Parliament Building and give a speech to the demonstrators to calm the unrest . While no accurate record of this speech exists , it did not have its intended effect ; Nagy essentially told the protesters to go home and let the Party handle things . The demonstrations soon escalated into a full-scale revolt as ÁVH secret policemen opened fire on the protesting citizens . Hungarian soldiers sent to crush the demonstrators instead sided with them , and Gerő soon called in Soviet intervention . Early in the morning of 24 October , Nagy was renamed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic again , in an attempt to appease the populace . However , he was initially isolated within the government , and powerless to stop the Soviet invasion of the capital that day . The decision to call in Soviet forces had already been made by Gerő and outgoing Prime Minister András Hegedüs the previous night , but many suspected that Nagy had signed the order . This perception was not helped by the fact that Nagy declared martial law on that same day and offered an amnesty to all rebels who laid down their arms , weakening the publics trust in him . The next day ( 25 October ) he announced he would begin negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops after order was restored . On 26 October , he began to meet with delegations from the Writers Union and student groups , as well as from the Borsod Workers Council in Miskolc . On 27 October , Nagy announced a major reformation of his government , to include several non-communist politicians including former president Zoltán Tildy as a Minister of State . At negotiations with Soviet representatives Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov , Nagy and the Hungarian government delegation pushed for a ceasefire and political solution . In the morning of 28 October , Nagy successfully prevented a massive attack on the main rebel strongholds at the Corvin Cinema and Kilián Barracks by Soviet troops and pro-regime Hungarian units . He negotiated a ceasefire with the Soviets , which came into effect at 12:15 and fighting began to die down across the city and country . Later that day , he gave a speech on the radio assessing the events as a national democratic movement , proclaiming his full support of the Revolution and agreeing to fulfill some of the publics demands . He announced the dissolution of the ÁVH and his intention to negotiate the full withdrawal of Soviet troops from the city . Nagy also supported the creation of a National Guard , a force of combined soldiers and armed civilians to maintain order amidst the chaos of the Revolution . On 29 October , as fighting died down across Budapest and Soviet troops began to withdraw , Nagy moved his office from the Party headquarters to the Parliament Building . He also began to meet and negotiated with several representatives of the armed groups that day , as well as the representatives of the workers councils that had been formed over the course of the previous week . By 30 October , Nagys reformist faction had gained full control of the Hungarian government . Ernő Gerő and the other Stalinist hard-liners had left for the Soviet Union , and Nagys government announced its intent to restore a multi-party system based on the coalition parties from 1945 . Throughout this period , Nagy remained steadfastly committed to Marxism ; but his conception of Marxism was as a science that cannot remain static , and he railed against the rigid dogmatism of the Stalinist monopoly . He did not intend a full return to multi-party liberal democracy but a limited one within a socialist framework , and was willing to allow the function of the pre-1948 coalition parties . Nagy was appointed to the temporary leadership committee of the newly-formed Hungarian Socialist Workers Party , which replaced the disintegrated Hungarian Working Peoples Party on 31 October . This was originally intended as a national-communist party that would preserve the gains of the Revolution . However , at a meeting of the Soviet Politburo that day , the Kremlin leaders decided that the Revolution had gone too far and needed to be crushed . On the night of 31 October – 1 November , Soviet troops began crossing back into Hungary , contrary to their declaration of 30 October expressing willingness to withdraw from the country entirely . Nagy protested this action to Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov ; the latter replied that the new troops were only there to cover the full withdrawal and protect Soviet citizens living in Hungary . This likely prompted Nagy to make his most controversial decision . In response to a major demand of the revolutionaries , he announced Hungarys withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and appealed through the UN for the great powers , such as the United States and the United Kingdom , to recognise Hungarys status as a neutral state . Late that night , General Secretary János Kádár went to the Soviet embassy , and the next day he was taken to Moscow . Between 1–3 November , Nikita Khrushchev traveled to various Warsaw Pact countries as well as to Yugoslavia to inform them of his plans to attack Hungary . On the advice of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito , he selected the then-Party General Secretary János Kádár as the countrys new leader on 2 November , and was willing to let Nagy remain in the government if he cooperated . On 3 November , Nagy formed a new government , this time with a Communist minority . It included members of the Communists , Independent Smallholders Party , Peasants Party , and Social Democrats . However , it would only be in office for less than a day . In the early morning hours of 4 November , the USSR launched Operation Whirlwind , a massive military attack on Budapest and on rebel strongholds throughout the country . Nagy made a dramatic announcement to the country and the world about this operation . However , to minimize damage he ordered the Hungarian Army not to resist the invaders . Soon after , he fled to the Yugoslav Embassy , where he and many of his followers were given sanctuary . In spite of a written safe conduct of free passage by János Kádár , on 22 November , Nagy was arrested by the Soviet forces as he was leaving the Yugoslav Embassy and taken to Snagov , Romania . Secret trial and execution . Subsequently , the Soviets returned Nagy to Hungary , where he was secretly charged with organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian Peoples Republic and with treason . Nagy was secretly tried , found guilty , sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958 . His trial and execution were made public only after the sentence had been carried out . According to Fedor Burlatsky , a Kremlin insider , Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed , as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries . American journalist John Gunther described the events leading to Nagys death as an episode of unparalleled infamy . Nagy was buried , along with his co-defendants , in the prison yard where the executions were carried out and years later was removed to a distant corner ( section 301 ) of the New Public Cemetery , Budapest , face-down , and with his hands and feet tied with barbed wire . Next to his grave stands a memorial bell inscribed in Latin , Hungarian , German and English . The Latin reads : Vivos voco / Mortuos plango / Fulgura frango , which is translated as : I call the living , I mourn the dead , I break the thunderbolts . Memorials and political rehabilitation . During the time when the Stalinist leadership of Hungary would not permit his death to be commemorated , or permit access to his burial place , a cenotaph in his honour was erected in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 16 June 1988 . In 1989 , Imre Nagy was rehabilitated and his remains reburied on the 31st anniversary of his execution in the same plot after a funeral organised in part by the democratic opposition to the countrys Stalinist regime . Over 200,000 people are estimated to have attended Nagys reinterment . The occasion of Nagys funeral was an important factor in the end of the communist government in Hungary . On 28 December 2018 , a popular statue of Nagy inaugurated in 1996 was removed from central Budapest to a less central location , in order to make way to a reconstructed monument that had stood on location from 1934 to 1945 . Opposition parties , mainly liberal , socialist and the remaining communists accused Viktor Orbáns right-wing government of historical revisionism . Writings . The collected writings of Nagy , most of which he wrote after his dismissal as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in April 1955 , were smuggled out of Hungary and published in the West under the title Imre Nagy on Communism . Family . Nagy was married to Mária Égető . The couple had one daughter , Erzsébet Nagy ( 1927–2008 ) , a Hungarian writer and translator . Erzsébet Nagy married Ferenc Jánosi . Imre Nagy did not object to his daughters romance and eventual marriage to a Protestant minister , attending their religious wedding ceremony in 1946 without Politburo permission . In 1982 , Erzsébet Nagy married János Vészi . Nagy in film and the arts . In 2003 and 2004 , the Hungarian director Márta Mészáros produced a film based on Nagys life after the revolution , entitled A temetetlen halott ( English : The Unburied Body ) ( IMDb entry ) . Nagy is mentioned and seen in the movie Children of Glory . The rehabilitation of Nagy after 40 years condemnation is referred to by a character in the 1991 Malayalam movie Sandhesam as part of an anti-communist rhetoric .</p><p>question: Which party was Imre Nagy a member of from 1917 to 1921?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: In captivity in Camp Berezovka near Lake Baikal in Siberia he participated in a Marxist discussion group until 1917 .

In January 1926 , Nagy and István Sinkovics established the Kaposvár office of the Socialist Workers’ Party of Hungary ( MSZMP ) , a semi-communist left-wing splinter group from the MSZDP . Nagy was successful in gaining 700 voters for the MSZMP Kaposvár parliamentary candidate , one of the partys few successes in the countryside west of Budapest . By this time Nagy had begun to prioritize his interest in agriculture over political leadership and rejected an offer from communist cadres from Vienna to build up the illegal KMP in western Hungary . The MSZMP in Kaposvár was prohibited and Nagy was fired from his insurance job in February 1927 and arrested on 27 February . He was released after two months in prison . While under police surveillance , Nagy found a job as an agent for the Phoenix Insurance Company . He was arrested again in December 1927 for three days and was called to Vienna by the KMP , arriving in March 1928 . He became head of the KMPs agrarian section and was sent back to Hungary in September 1928 under a false identity to build up underground communist networks . His efforts were largely a failure , his largest successes being the publishing of three issues of a small journal and his avoidance of arrest . His advocacy of legal political activity over the partys preference for largely impotent clandestine work in villages was dismissed as right-deviancy by the ultra-left KMP leadership . Years in Moscow . In December 1929 , he traveled to the Soviet Union , arriving in Moscow in February 1930 to participate in the KMPs second congress . He rejoined the Communist Party , also becoming a Soviet citizen . He was engaged in agricultural research at the International Agrarian Institute for six years , but also worked in the Hungarian section of the Comintern . He was expelled from the party on 8 January 1936 and worked for the Soviet Statistical Service from the summer of 1936 onward . Under the codename Volodia , Nagy served the NKVD secret police as an informer from 1933 to 1941 , giving up the names of over 200 comrades , mostly from the Agrarian Institute , who were then arrested and in at least 15 cases executed by the secret police . The NKVD praised him as a qualified agent , who shows great initiative and an ability to approach people . The support that Nagy received from the Soviet leadership after the Second World War was to some extent a result of his loyal service as a foreigner and denouncer to the NKVD . Minister in Communist Hungary . After the Second World War , Nagy returned to Hungary . He was the Minister of Agriculture in the government of Béla Miklós de Dálnok , delegated by the Hungarian Communist Party . He distributed land among the peasant population . In the next government , led by Tildy , he was the Minister of Interior . At this period he played an active role in the expulsion of the Hungarian Germans . In the communist government , he served as Minister of Agriculture and in other posts . He was also Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary from 1947 to 1949 , a largely ceremonial position . In 1951 , he signed , with the rest of the Politburo , the note ordering János Kádárs arrest , resulting in Kádárs torture and sentencing to life in prison after a show trial . After two years as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic ( 1953–1955 ) , during which he promoted his New Course in Socialism , Nagy fell out of favour with the Soviet Politburo . He was deprived of his Hungarian Central Committee , Politburo , and all other Party functions and , on 18 April 1955 , he was sacked as Chairman of the Council of Ministers . 1956 Revolution . Following Nikita Khrushchevs Secret Speech denouncing the crimes of Stalin on 25 February 1956 , dissent began to grow in Eastern Bloc against the ruling Stalinist-era party leaders . In Hungary , Mátyás Rákosi—who self-styled as Stalins greatest disciple—came under increasingly intense criticism for his policies from both the Party and general populace , with more and more prominent voices calling for his resignation . This public criticism often took the form of the Petőfi Circle—a debating club established by the DISZ student youth union to discuss Communist policy—which soon became one of the foremost outlets of dissent against the regime . While Nagy himself never attended a Petőfi Circle meeting , he was kept well informed of events by his close associates Miklós Vásárhelyi and Géza Losonczy , who informed him of the vast popular support expressed for him at the meetings and the widespread desire for his restoration to the leadership . In the face of widespread public pressure on Rákosi , the Soviets forced the unpopular leader to resign from power on 18 July 1956 and leave for the Soviet Union . However , they replaced him with his equally hard-line second in command Ernő Gerő , a change which did little to mollify public dissent . Nagy was a prominent guest at the 6 October reburial of former secret police chief László Rajk , who had been purged by the Rákosi regime and later rehabilitated . He was readmitted to the Party on 13 October in the midst of growing revolutionary fervor . On 22 October , students from the Technical University in Budapest compiled a list of sixteen national policy demands , the third of which was Nagys restoration to the premiership . In the afternoon of 23 October , students and workers gathered in Budapest for a massive opposition demonstration arranged by the Technical University students , chanting—among other things—slogans of support for Imre Nagy . While the ex-premier sympathized with their reformist demands , he was hesitant to support the movement , believing it to be too radical in its demands . While he was in favor of changes to the system , he preferred those to be made within the framework of his New Course of 1953–55 and not a revolutionary upheaval . He also feared that the demonstration was a provocation by Gerő and Hegedüs to frame him as inciting rebellion and to crack down on the opposition . His associates ultimately convinced him to travel to the Parliament Building and give a speech to the demonstrators to calm the unrest . While no accurate record of this speech exists , it did not have its intended effect ; Nagy essentially told the protesters to go home and let the Party handle things . The demonstrations soon escalated into a full-scale revolt as ÁVH secret policemen opened fire on the protesting citizens . Hungarian soldiers sent to crush the demonstrators instead sided with them , and Gerő soon called in Soviet intervention . Early in the morning of 24 October , Nagy was renamed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Peoples Republic again , in an attempt to appease the populace . However , he was initially isolated within the government , and powerless to stop the Soviet invasion of the capital that day . The decision to call in Soviet forces had already been made by Gerő and outgoing Prime Minister András Hegedüs the previous night , but many suspected that Nagy had signed the order . This perception was not helped by the fact that Nagy declared martial law on that same day and offered an amnesty to all rebels who laid down their arms , weakening the publics trust in him . The next day ( 25 October ) he announced he would begin negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops after order was restored . On 26 October , he began to meet with delegations from the Writers Union and student groups , as well as from the Borsod Workers Council in Miskolc . On 27 October , Nagy announced a major reformation of his government , to include several non-communist politicians including former president Zoltán Tildy as a Minister of State . At negotiations with Soviet representatives Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov , Nagy and the Hungarian government delegation pushed for a ceasefire and political solution . In the morning of 28 October , Nagy successfully prevented a massive attack on the main rebel strongholds at the Corvin Cinema and Kilián Barracks by Soviet troops and pro-regime Hungarian units . He negotiated a ceasefire with the Soviets , which came into effect at 12:15 and fighting began to die down across the city and country . Later that day , he gave a speech on the radio assessing the events as a national democratic movement , proclaiming his full support of the Revolution and agreeing to fulfill some of the publics demands . He announced the dissolution of the ÁVH and his intention to negotiate the full withdrawal of Soviet troops from the city . Nagy also supported the creation of a National Guard , a force of combined soldiers and armed civilians to maintain order amidst the chaos of the Revolution . On 29 October , as fighting died down across Budapest and Soviet troops began to withdraw , Nagy moved his office from the Party headquarters to the Parliament Building . He also began to meet and negotiated with several representatives of the armed groups that day , as well as the representatives of the workers councils that had been formed over the course of the previous week . By 30 October , Nagys reformist faction had gained full control of the Hungarian government . Ernő Gerő and the other Stalinist hard-liners had left for the Soviet Union , and Nagys government announced its intent to restore a multi-party system based on the coalition parties from 1945 . Throughout this period , Nagy remained steadfastly committed to Marxism ; but his conception of Marxism was as a science that cannot remain static , and he railed against the rigid dogmatism of the Stalinist monopoly . He did not intend a full return to multi-party liberal democracy but a limited one within a socialist framework , and was willing to allow the function of the pre-1948 coalition parties . Nagy was appointed to the temporary leadership committee of the newly-formed Hungarian Socialist Workers Party , which replaced the disintegrated Hungarian Working Peoples Party on 31 October . This was originally intended as a national-communist party that would preserve the gains of the Revolution . However , at a meeting of the Soviet Politburo that day , the Kremlin leaders decided that the Revolution had gone too far and needed to be crushed . On the night of 31 October – 1 November , Soviet troops began crossing back into Hungary , contrary to their declaration of 30 October expressing willingness to withdraw from the country entirely . Nagy protested this action to Soviet Ambassador Yuri Andropov ; the latter replied that the new troops were only there to cover the full withdrawal and protect Soviet citizens living in Hungary . This likely prompted Nagy to make his most controversial decision . In response to a major demand of the revolutionaries , he announced Hungarys withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and appealed through the UN for the great powers , such as the United States and the United Kingdom , to recognise Hungarys status as a neutral state . Late that night , General Secretary János Kádár went to the Soviet embassy , and the next day he was taken to Moscow . Between 1–3 November , Nikita Khrushchev traveled to various Warsaw Pact countries as well as to Yugoslavia to inform them of his plans to attack Hungary . On the advice of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito , he selected the then-Party General Secretary János Kádár as the countrys new leader on 2 November , and was willing to let Nagy remain in the government if he cooperated . On 3 November , Nagy formed a new government , this time with a Communist minority . It included members of the Communists , Independent Smallholders Party , Peasants Party , and Social Democrats . However , it would only be in office for less than a day . In the early morning hours of 4 November , the USSR launched Operation Whirlwind , a massive military attack on Budapest and on rebel strongholds throughout the country . Nagy made a dramatic announcement to the country and the world about this operation . However , to minimize damage he ordered the Hungarian Army not to resist the invaders . Soon after , he fled to the Yugoslav Embassy , where he and many of his followers were given sanctuary . In spite of a written safe conduct of free passage by János Kádár , on 22 November , Nagy was arrested by the Soviet forces as he was leaving the Yugoslav Embassy and taken to Snagov , Romania . Secret trial and execution . Subsequently , the Soviets returned Nagy to Hungary , where he was secretly charged with organizing the overthrow of the Hungarian Peoples Republic and with treason . Nagy was secretly tried , found guilty , sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958 . His trial and execution were made public only after the sentence had been carried out . According to Fedor Burlatsky , a Kremlin insider , Nikita Khrushchev had Nagy executed , as a lesson to all other leaders in socialist countries . American journalist John Gunther described the events leading to Nagys death as an episode of unparalleled infamy . Nagy was buried , along with his co-defendants , in the prison yard where the executions were carried out and years later was removed to a distant corner ( section 301 ) of the New Public Cemetery , Budapest , face-down , and with his hands and feet tied with barbed wire . Next to his grave stands a memorial bell inscribed in Latin , Hungarian , German and English . The Latin reads : Vivos voco / Mortuos plango / Fulgura frango , which is translated as : I call the living , I mourn the dead , I break the thunderbolts . Memorials and political rehabilitation . During the time when the Stalinist leadership of Hungary would not permit his death to be commemorated , or permit access to his burial place , a cenotaph in his honour was erected in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris on 16 June 1988 . In 1989 , Imre Nagy was rehabilitated and his remains reburied on the 31st anniversary of his execution in the same plot after a funeral organised in part by the democratic opposition to the countrys Stalinist regime . Over 200,000 people are estimated to have attended Nagys reinterment . The occasion of Nagys funeral was an important factor in the end of the communist government in Hungary . On 28 December 2018 , a popular statue of Nagy inaugurated in 1996 was removed from central Budapest to a less central location , in order to make way to a reconstructed monument that had stood on location from 1934 to 1945 . Opposition parties , mainly liberal , socialist and the remaining communists accused Viktor Orbáns right-wing government of historical revisionism . Writings . The collected writings of Nagy , most of which he wrote after his dismissal as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in April 1955 , were smuggled out of Hungary and published in the West under the title Imre Nagy on Communism . Family . Nagy was married to Mária Égető . The couple had one daughter , Erzsébet Nagy ( 1927–2008 ) , a Hungarian writer and translator . Erzsébet Nagy married Ferenc Jánosi . Imre Nagy did not object to his daughters romance and eventual marriage to a Protestant minister , attending their religious wedding ceremony in 1946 without Politburo permission . In 1982 , Erzsébet Nagy married János Vészi . Nagy in film and the arts . In 2003 and 2004 , the Hungarian director Márta Mészáros produced a film based on Nagys life after the revolution , entitled A temetetlen halott ( English : The Unburied Body ) ( IMDb entry ) . Nagy is mentioned and seen in the movie Children of Glory . The rehabilitation of Nagy after 40 years condemnation is referred to by a character in the 1991 Malayalam movie Sandhesam as part of an anti-communist rhetoric .</p><p>question: Which party was Imre Nagy a member of from 1924 to 1943?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: After a month of training by the Cheka in subversive activities , the Hungarian Communist Party ( KMP ) sent Nagy along with 277 other Hungarian communists to Hungary in April 1921 to build up an underground conspiratorial network in a country where the Communist Party had been banned since 1919 . Nagy reached Kaposvár in late May 1921 . Upon arrival , he joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary ( MSZDP ) . After working temporary jobs in the rest of 1921 and early 1922 , he joined the First Hungarian Insurance Company and became an office worker in Kaposvár .

The squadron aircraft allowance was subsequently raised from 6 to 12 , although only 11 aircraft were ever in the inventory . - 5 September 1939 : President Franklin D . Roosevelt issued his proclamation of neutrality , paving the way for the establishment of the Neutrality Patrol . By 20 September 1939 , the Neutrality Patrol was in effect ; VP-52 teamed with VP-53 and a group of destroyers to protect the approaches to Norfolk . - 1 October 1939 : VP-52 was relocated to NS Charleston , South Carolina , to fill gaps in the coverage of the southern Atlantic coastline . - August – October 1940 : VP-52 operated from advanced bases at Parris Island and Winyah Bay , South Carolina , with tender support by USS Owl and . - December 1940 – January 1941 : VP-52 exchanged its well-worn P2Y-2 aircraft , the last still in operation in the fleet , for new PBY-5s . The P2Y-2s were flown from Charleston to NAS Pensacola , Florida , for use as training planes . The PBY-5 aircraft were ferried across country by VP-14 from NAS San Diego , California , and delivered to VP- 52 in Pensacola in January . While en route , aircraft 14-P-11 flown by Lieutenant ( jg ) Murray Hanson , met foul weather and made an emergency landing on a dry lake on King Ranch , Texas .

The squadron operated 10 PBY-5s from this location , with a detachment of two aircraft at NAS Norfolk . This remained the forward U.S . base until July 1943 , when operations were moved to locations in the United Kingdom . The Norfolk detachment rejoined the squadron at Argentia on 25 June 1941 . - 24 May 1941 : all VP-52 aircraft were launched in the face of strong gales to search for the German battleship Bismarck , which had just engaged and sunk HMS Hood in the Strait of Denmark . The ship was not spotted , as it had turned south of the patrol area . Of the 11 aircraft aloft , none were able to return to NAS Argentia due to bad weather at the landing site , but all ll ultimately returned to base . - 29 May 1941 : VP-52 deployed four aircraft to Iceland , based on at Reykjavik . The planes surveyed the east coast of Greenland where Danish weather stations were suspected of being in use by the Germans for relaying forecasts to the U-boat wolfpacks . Inspections of the facilities showed them to be abandoned , and the detachment returned to NAS Argentia on 8 June 1941 . - 1 Jul 1941 : The Support Force was reorganized on this date to become Patrol Wing 7 , and its squadrons 51 , 52 , 53 and 55 became VPs 71 , 72 , 73 , and 74 respectively . - 3 July 1941 : Four new PBY-5 aircraft recently received by the squadron departed NAS Argentia for Reykjavik .

The three remaining aircraft of VP-72 departed NAS Alameda later in the day with eight aircraft of VP-71 . Two of the three went down at sea en route . The crews were quickly rescued and one aircraft was salvaged , but the other sank . - 24 December 1941 : Three squadron aircraft were put on patrol operating out of NAS Kaneohe Bay flying patrol sectors of 11 to 12 hours duration . A detachment of two other aircraft flew to Johnston Island . - 31 January 1942 : Two more squadron aircraft left behind at NAS Alameda , completed the trans-Pacific flight rejoining the squadron at NAS Kaneohe Bay . - 17 February 1942 : Plane No . 6 crashed on a predawn takeoff for a patrol from NAS Kaneohe Bay , killing all but one of the crew . - 14 March – 23 May 1942 : VP-72 deployed a detachment to Nouméa with six aircraft , returning on 23 May 1942 . One aircraft hit a coral head while taxiing at Kanton Island , requiring two weeks to repair . - 30 April 1942 : During this period , patrol wing aircraft at NAS Kaneohe Bay were pooled . Since some squadrons had the newer PBY-5A , all hands had to do transition training in case they might have to fly that type aircraft . Initially , crews disliked the PBY-5A compared to the non-amphibious PBY-5 . It was slower in the air , harder to get airborne , more vulnerable to damage in open-sea landings , and less capable of single-engine operation . - 4 September – 7 October 1942 : VP-72 began deploying to Luganville Seaplane Base , Espiritu Santo by sections , with the last plane arriving 13 September 1942 . On 7 October 1942 , the first action with the enemy took place when Lieutenant Cocowitch was fired on by a Japanese ship . - 17 December 1942 – 6 January 1943 : Ten new PBY-5A replacement aircraft were ferried to the squadron from NAS Kaneohe Bay .

Review of postwar enemy records does not indicate any losses by the enemy on this date . - 6 July 1943 : By mid-June 1943 , the squadron had been relieved and began its return to the continental United States aboard . It was reformed on 6 July 1943 , at NAS San Diego , remaining at this location undergoing crew training until mid-August . - 23 August 1943 : VP-72 completed its trans-Pacific flight from NAS San Diego to NAS Kaneohe Bay . The squadron trained at NAS Kaneohe Bay until 1 October 1943 , when detachments were formed and deployed to Kanton , Baker , Johnston and Midway Islands . - 1 November 1943 : The detachments rejoined the squadron at NAS Kaneohe Bay . The squadron then formed two detachments for another deployment . Half of the squadron remained at NAS Kaneohe Bay , while the other half deployed to Funafuti . - 11 November 1943 : The NAS Kaneohe Bay detachment joined the rest of the squadron at Funafuti , with tender support provided by . During this period the squadron was assigned sector searches , night anti-shipping patrols , and mine-laying and Dumbo ( air-sea rescue ) missions . By 1 December 1943 , the squadrons mission shifted solely to Dumbo missions , with one to two aircraft detachments at Funafuti , Nanumea , Apamama , Tarawa and Makin islands . The Dumbo missions were often flown in coordination with fast surface warships or submarines posted along the routes strike aircraft flew on their missions . The aircraft located the downed aircrewsthen guided the ship or submarine to them . If surface conditions permitted , the seaplanes would land and rescue the crews . - 1 January 1944 : The new year brought with it a change of duties for the squadron . The PBYs were adapted for aerial minelaying . Several missions were conducted throughout the month , mining approaches to bypassed Japanese island garrisons to deny them resupply by sea . - 1 February – 1 March 1944 : In February , the squadron was consolidated at Funafuti for maintenance , while continuing to carry out a full mission schedule of patrols and Dumbo missions . Two aircraft had been lost without injuries to crews : one during takeoff , the other while attempting to land in rough seas during a Dumbo mission . By 1 March 1944 , VP-72 was again split into detachments operating from Makin , Kwajalein and Eniwetok with tender support was provided by . - 8 June 1944 : VP-72 was consolidated at Ebeye Island , with all aircraft and crews berthed ashore . Maintenance and overhaul of the remaining squadron aircraft were conducted to prepare them for the return to NAS Kaneohe Bay when relieved . - 17 July 1944 : VP-72 was relieved by VP-18 for return to NAS Kaneohe Bay and eventual transfer back to the continental United States . - 1 August 1944 : The squadron arrived at San Diego and all hands were given 30-day rehabilitation leave . - 1 September – 1 October 1944 : The squadron was reformed at NAAS Brown Field , California , under the operational control of FAW-14 .

He previously served as a professor of economics at the University of Vienna , and after joining politics , as the spokesman of the Austrian Green Party . As a descendant of the Russian aristocratic von der Bellen ( Van der Bellen ) family of patrilineal Dutch ancestry , he was born in Austria to Russian and Estonian parents who were refugees from Stalinism , and became a naturalized citizen of Austria together with his parents in 1958 . He was a member of the National Council representing the Green Party there from 1994 to 2012 , and served as both leader of the party as well as its parliamentary group . He ran as a nominally independent candidate supported by the Greens in the 2016 presidential election , and finished second out of six in the first round before winning the second round against Norbert Hofer , a member of the Freedom Party . On 1 July , before he was due to be sworn into office , the results of the second round of voting were annulled by the Constitutional Court due to absentee votes being improperly counted too early , requiring the election to be re-held . On 4 December 2016 , he won the ensuing election , taking approximately 54% of the vote . Van der Bellen has described himself as a centrist liberal and supports green and social liberal policies . As discussed in his 2015 book , he is supportive of the European Union and advocates European federalism . During the presidential election , he appealed to the political centre and was endorsed by the leaders of both the Social Democratic Party and the conservative Peoples Party . Van der Bellen is the second green president of a European Union country ( after Raimonds Vējonis of Latvia ) and the first to be directly elected by popular vote . Personal life . Origin and youth . In the 1700s Van der Bellens patrilineal ancestors emigrated from the Netherlands to the Russian Empire . During the Russian Civil War ( 1917-1922 ) part of his family escaped from the Bolsheviks and migrated to the newly independent Republic of Estonia . Before this Van der Bellens grandfather Aleksander von der Bellen served as head of the civilian regional government in Pskov . Claiming Dutch origins the family changed its name from „von der Bellen“ to „Van der Bellen“ . In 1931 Van der Bellens father Alexander married Estonian Alma Sieboldt in Kihelkonna in Saaremaa . Subsequently , he obtained Estonian citizenship . In June 1940 , as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact , Estonia was invaded by the Red Army and later annexed by the USSR . In February or March 1941 Van der Bellens father , mother , and older sister Vivian-Diana moved to Nazi Germany ; in line with the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty they were accepted as so-called Volksdeutsche . Via Lauksargiai ( former Laugszargen , Memelland ) and a German resettlement camp in Werneck at Würzburg , Van der Bellens parents moved to Vienna , where their son Alexander was born in 1944 and baptized into the Lutheran Church . As the Red Army approached Vienna , the family escaped to the Kauner valley in Tyrol , where his father later became active as a businessman again . In 1954 , after completing primary school in Innsbruck , Van der Bellen switched to the Academic Grammar School Innsbruck ( Akademisches Gymnasium Innsbruck ) , where he took his A-Levels in 1962 . Until this time Van der Bellen had Estonian citizenship like his parents , obtaining Austrian citizenship around 1958 . According to Van der Bellen , he did not complete mandatory service in the Austrian Armed Forces . He underwent the medical examination for military service twice , the first one resulting in him being rated unfit ( untauglich ) . However , he successfully passed the second one . Later , he received several respites during his studies and after his marriage . After that Van der Bellen was no longer summoned for service , due to his subsequent professorship . Education . Van der Bellen studied economics at the University of Innsbruck and obtained a masters degree in 1966 . With his dissertation Kollektive Haushalte und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmungen : Probleme ihrer Koordination ( Collective households and public-service enterprises : Problems of their coordination ) he was awarded the title of Dr . rer . oec ( doctor rerum oeconomicarum ) in 1970 . From 1968 to 1971 he served as scientific assistant to Clemens August Andreae at the Institute for Public Finance at the University of Innsbruck , and from 1972 to 1974 as a research fellow at the Berlin Social Science Center ( WZB ) . He was university assistant at the Institute for Public Finance at the University of Innsbruck and was awarded the qualification as university lecturer ( habilitation ) in 1975 . He established friendship with Turkish economist Murat R . Sertel , with whom he worked on decision and preference theories and later on published several articles and discussion papers . In 1976 Van der Bellen became associate professor at the University of Innsbruck , where he remained until 1980 . During this time he moved to Vienna to study and research from 1977 to 1980 at the Federal Academy of Public Administration . From 1980 to 1999 he was extraordinary university professor for economics at the University of Vienna . Between 1990 and 1994 he there also became dean of the faculty for economics at University of Vienna . In October 1999 he became parliamentary leader of the Greens in the National Council and thus resigned as university professor in January 2009 . Van der Bellen retired in February 2009 . Van der Bellens research focused on planning and financing procedures in the public sector , infrastructure financing , fiscal policy , public expenditure , government regulation policy , public undertakings , and environmental and transport policy . He has published in professional journals such as the Die Betriebswirtschaft , Econometrica , Journal of Economic Theory , Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft , Public Choice , Wirtschaftspolitische Blätter and the Zeitschrift für öffentliche und gemeinwirtschaftliche Unternehmen . Family . Van der Bellen married when he was 18 years old and became a father for the first time at 19 . His relationship with Brigitte ( born Hüttner , 1943–2018 ) lasted over 50 years , until they divorced in 2015 . He had two sons with her . Since December 2015 Van der Bellen has been married to a longtime friend and managing director of the Greens Club , Doris Schmidauer . He lives in Vienna and in Kaunertal , Tyrol . Religion . As a young man Van der Bellen left the Evangelical Church , because he was upset about his local pastor . According to his own words he does not believe in the one God , but in a message or vision ( Botschaft oder Vision ) , which in his view the New Testament states . However , in an interview in 2019 he stated , that he re-joined the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession the same year . Freemason . According to his own statement , Van der Bellen joined the only existing Freemason chapter in Innsbruck at the time , although he participated at meetings for a year , which he described as being active . After that , as a purely passive member , I paid the membership fee for about 10 years and finally left on my explicit request ( Danach habe ich als rein passives Mitglied noch etwa 10 Jahre lang den Mitgliedsbeitrag bezahlt und bin schließlich auf meinen expliziten Wunsch hin ausgeschieden ) , Van der Bellen in a ZIB 2 elections interview with Armin Wolf ( 18 May 2016 ) . According to Van der Bellen , he is no longer a Freemason . Estonian citizenship . After Van der Bellens victory in the 2016 Austrian presidential elections , President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves congratulated him . The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stated that Van der Bellen could get back his Estonian passport at any time . This is possible because Van der Bellens parents were citizens of Estonia as of 16 June 1940 ; children of such parents are automatically accepted as citizens . Urmas Paet , former foreign minister of Estonia and MEP said : the election results are a reason to congratulate Austrians twice . For Estonia and its people , the fact that Austria has elected an Estonian citizen as its president also plays a role . Nickname . Van der Bellen is sometimes also called Sascha ( which is an abbreviation of his first name ) by his friends , colleagues , and within his party . Political career . Joining politics . Van der Bellen was a member of the Social Democratic Party from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , but his interests later turned towards the environmental movement . His former postgraduate Peter Pilz , back then the spokesman of the Green Party , brought Van der Bellen into his party . Van der Bellen later described these changes as a development from an arrogant anti-capitalist to a generous left-liberal , although the latter self-image in his autobiography of 2015 also changed into a liberal Anglo-Saxon coinage . In 1992 , Van der Bellen was nominated by the Greens for the office of the President of the Court of Audit ; he was defeated by the ÖVP-close Franz Fiedler . After the Greens suffered significant losses in the 1995 legislative elections on 17 December , Van der Bellen took over the party chairmanship from Christoph Chorherr in December 1997 and remained until October 2008 , being the longest-serving spokesman in the history of the Austrian Greens , with almost eleven years in office . He assumed chairmanship with the party having 4.8% approval in polls at that time . He led the party through three elections , each higher than the last : in the 1999 legislative elections the party got 7.4% of the vote , in the 2002 legislative elections it got 9.5% of the vote , and in the 2006 legislative elections the party got 11.05% of the vote . After losses in the 2008 legislative elections , in which the Green Partys voteshare dropped to 10.11% , Van der Bellen , dubbed the green professor by the media , resigned on 3 October 2008 as spokesman of the Green Party . He handed over the office to the Third President of the National Council at the time , Eva Glawischnig . As designated spokesperson she was elected administrative party leader on 24 October and later officially endorsed and sworn in by the party congress ( Bundeskongress ) . Member of parliament . With the beginning of the XIX . legislative period on 7 November 1994 Van der Bellen functioned as a member of the National Council for the first time and held this position until 2012 . During the XXIV . legislative period he dropped out of the National Council on 5 July 2012 . From 1999 to 2008 he was parliamentary leader of the Green Party in the National Council . During his time in the National Council , Van der Bellen also served as a member of the Budget , Main , Science , Financial , Industrial ( as deputy chairman ) , Administrative and Foreign Affairs ( as clerk and deputy chairman ) committees as well as member of several subcommittees . In 2009/10 he was a substitute member and from 2010 to 2012 a member of the Austrian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg . After the 2008 legislative elections , he was proposed by the Greens , who were no longer the third strongest party , as a counter-candidate to the controversial FPÖ candidate Martin Graf for the post of Third President of the National Council , however , he failed to win the vote on 28 October 2008 : Graf was elected with 109 out of 156 valid votes , Van der Bellen only received 27 , and the remaining 20 votes went to other MPs . University commissioner . On February 2011 , Van der Bellen was elected by the red-green city and state government as Commissioner for Universities and Research ( also : Commissioner of the City of Vienna for Universities and Research , denotation in 2013 ) . While he himself volunteered this activity , in addition to his still exercised National Council mandate , the new infrastructure office for him with a budget of 210,000 euros annually was endowed . As a university commissioner , he campaigned for the improvement of the relationship between the city of Vienna and the universities located there . At his initiative , regular meetings took place for the first time between representatives of the Viennese universities and the Municipal Department 35 ( Municipal Department of the City of Vienna ) in order to improve cooperation in immigration and residence matters for third-country students and researchers . The initiative was taken up by the Austrian Universities Conference - The Austrian Conference of Rectors ( uniko ) and extended from Vienna to the whole of Austria . On the initiative of University Commissioner Van der Bellen , the Vienna University Circle , an informal advisory board composed of rectors and vice-rectors of Viennese universities , including the research institution Institute of Science and Technology Austria ( IST Austria ) , were launched . Vienna state parliament . At the 2010 Viennese state elections on 10 October Van der Bellen stood as a candidate on the 29th place of the list of the Vienna Greens . With the elections slogan Go Professor go ! he reached 11,952 preferred votes and thus achieved a precedence on the first place . Although he stated in multiple interviews : Should I get the preferential votes and it comes to a red-green government , I will definitely move into the Landtag , he still did not accept the Gemeinderat mandate after the elections and remained in the National Council til 5 July 2012 . On 14 June 2012 , Van der Bellen announced in a press conference to swap from the National Council to the Vienna Gemeinderat and Landtag . On 5 July 2012 he left the National Council . The inauguration took place in September 2012 at the first Gemeinderat meeting after the summer break . In January 2015 , it was announced that Van der Bellen would retreat from Viennas municipal politics at the end of the legislative period . In the internal list election of the Vienna Greens on 14 February , after the application deadline , he did not compete in the internal party candidacy . Thus he was no longer on a selectable place on the electoral lists of the Greens in the 2015 Viennese state elections . Political views . In 2001 , Van der Bellen said that he turned from an arrogant anti-capitalist into a broad-minded left-liberal over the course of his political career . In his 2015 autobiography , Van der Bellen described himself as a liberal positioned in the political centre while downplaying his earlier description as left-liberal , and said he was inspired by the Anglo-Saxon liberal tradition , particularly John Stuart Mill . He is strongly supportive of the European Union , and advocates European federalism . During the 2016 presidential election , he appealed to the political centre and used Unser Präsident der Mitte ( Our President of the Centre ) for his campaign slogan . Van der Bellen has argued that Europe should accept refugees who have fled to Europe from war zones in Syria and elsewhere , and has often mentioned his own background as the son of refugees in debates . He has opposed the governments decision to impose a limit on how many asylum-seekers it will allow into Austria . Van der Bellen has commented that due to emerging Islamophobia and prejudice against women wearing headscarves , he could foresee a day when all non-Muslim women might also be asked to wear headscarves as a sign of solidarity with women who wear them on religious grounds . The remarks were criticized widely , especially on the political right . Van der Bellen has criticized U.S . President Donald Trump , warning of the dangers of right-wing populism . He has opined that the British withdrawal from the European Union is damaging to the economies of both the United Kingdom and Europe . He is opposed to recognising the Russian annexation of Crimea . He has stated that the Austrian embassy in Israel should remain in Tel Aviv . Van der Bellen has criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his supporters after mass pro-Erdoğan protests by Turks in Austria , saying : In Austria there is freedom to demonstrate as long as it is peaceful . [ ... ] Everyone that accepts the right to demonstrate , has to see that the same rights – such as freedom of speech , press freedom , independent justice system , and freedom to demonstrate are being denied in Turkey by President Erdogan . Presidential election . Before the election . Since August 2014 Van der Bellen has already been regarded as a presidential candidate . The Green Party reserved the domain vdb2016.at through the media agency Media Brothers for a possible presidential candidacy of Van der Bellen in November 2014 . After its reservation the party delegated the domain to the Association Together for Van der Bellen as of 6 January 2016 . Campaign . On 8 January 2016 , Van der Bellen officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election by video message . Van der Bellen ran as an independent candidate and thus non-party nominee for the office of President . As the longest-serving leader of the Green party ( from 1997 to 2008 ) and as an afterwards still active party member , Van der Bellens claimed nonpartisanism was questioned and challenged throughout his presidential campaign . However , Van der Bellen officially suspended his party membership at the Greens as of 23 May 2016 , demonstrating his willingness to strive for a nonpartisan incumbency . Regardless of that the Green Party still supported him during his campaign ; establishing the Association Together for Van der Bellen – Independent Initiative for the 2016 Presidential Election which comprised six employees and premises as well as 1.2 million euros financial aid . The association is headquartered within the Green Partys head office , executive director of the association is Van der Bellens campaign manager Lothar Lockl . For the repetition of the second ballot , the association received a total of 18,398 private donations , which amounted to about 2.7 million euros . In comparison Van der Bellens run-off opponent Norbert Hofer was vested with 3.4 million euros by his party . The Greens however , suspected that this sum only encompassed monetary and no material donations . By running as a non-partisan candidate , Van der Bellen could also avoid an official requirement for approval of the Green Party Congress , therefore discussions about the party basis as well as a possible non-unanimous voting result were bypassed . As an independent candidate , it would legally not have been necessary for him to disclose the campaign donations . Nevertheless , the Association Together for Van der Bellen still published them on their website . Election . In the first round of the 2016 presidential election , Van der Bellen ranked second with 21.34% of the votes being behind Norbert Hofer with 35.05% . In the second round of voting ( the runoff election ) on 22 May 2016 , the provisional final result excluding postal votes was : Norbert Hofer with 51.93% and Alexander Van der Bellen with 48.07% . Therefore no winner could be determined on election night . On the following day ( 23 May 2016 ) , Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka announced the final results including postal votes , according to which Van der Bellen received 50.35% and Hofer 49.64% of valid votes . Van der Bellen had a lead of 31,026 votes on Hofer . The voter turnout was 72.7% . The complete final result was announced with a correction ( in a constituency votes were counted twice ) , after which the difference has been reduced to less than 31,000 valid votes between Van der Bellen and Hofer , but this had little effect on the total percentage . ( The changes only affected the third decimal place. ) Following the election , the designated President Van der Bellen reaffirmed his views on the Freedom Party and stated that he would not charge them with the task to form a government , even if they became the largest party . This would have been a novelty in the history of the Second Republic , since so far all Presidents had charged the chairperson of the largest party with the government formation . On 8 June , Freedom Party chairman Heinz-Christian Strache brought in a 150-page notice of appeal to the Constitutional Court , which was intended to highlight deficiencies in the conduct of the second voting round . On 1 July 2016 , the Constitutional Court consented the electoral appeal of the Freedom Party . Because of irregularities that occurred in the counting of postal votes , the election had to be repeated in the whole of Austria . Van der Bellen also won the second runoff election postponed to 4 December 2016 , receiving 53.8% of valid votes ( with a voter turnout of 74.2% ) . While Van der Bellens lead in the run-off vote on May 2016 amounted to barely less than 31,000 votes , he was able to expand his lead in the second run-off vote on December 2016 to over 348,000 valid votes . Inauguration . Alexander Van der Bellen was inaugurated as President of Austria on 26 January 2017 . After his inaugural speech he met with the Kern government and was greeted with a military ceremony as the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesheer . Honours and awards .

As a young man Van der Bellen left the Evangelical Church , because he was upset about his local pastor . According to his own words he does not believe in the one God , but in a message or vision ( Botschaft oder Vision ) , which in his view the New Testament states . However , in an interview in 2019 he stated , that he re-joined the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession the same year . Freemason . According to his own statement , Van der Bellen joined the only existing Freemason chapter in Innsbruck at the time , although he participated at meetings for a year , which he described as being active . After that , as a purely passive member , I paid the membership fee for about 10 years and finally left on my explicit request ( Danach habe ich als rein passives Mitglied noch etwa 10 Jahre lang den Mitgliedsbeitrag bezahlt und bin schließlich auf meinen expliziten Wunsch hin ausgeschieden ) , Van der Bellen in a ZIB 2 elections interview with Armin Wolf ( 18 May 2016 ) . According to Van der Bellen , he is no longer a Freemason . Estonian citizenship . After Van der Bellens victory in the 2016 Austrian presidential elections , President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves congratulated him . The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have stated that Van der Bellen could get back his Estonian passport at any time . This is possible because Van der Bellens parents were citizens of Estonia as of 16 June 1940 ; children of such parents are automatically accepted as citizens . Urmas Paet , former foreign minister of Estonia and MEP said : the election results are a reason to congratulate Austrians twice . For Estonia and its people , the fact that Austria has elected an Estonian citizen as its president also plays a role . Nickname . Van der Bellen is sometimes also called Sascha ( which is an abbreviation of his first name ) by his friends , colleagues , and within his party . Political career . Joining politics . Van der Bellen was a member of the Social Democratic Party from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , but his interests later turned towards the environmental movement . His former postgraduate Peter Pilz , back then the spokesman of the Green Party , brought Van der Bellen into his party . Van der Bellen later described these changes as a development from an arrogant anti-capitalist to a generous left-liberal , although the latter self-image in his autobiography of 2015 also changed into a liberal Anglo-Saxon coinage . In 1992 , Van der Bellen was nominated by the Greens for the office of the President of the Court of Audit ; he was defeated by the ÖVP-close Franz Fiedler . After the Greens suffered significant losses in the 1995 legislative elections on 17 December , Van der Bellen took over the party chairmanship from Christoph Chorherr in December 1997 and remained until October 2008 , being the longest-serving spokesman in the history of the Austrian Greens , with almost eleven years in office . He assumed chairmanship with the party having 4.8% approval in polls at that time . He led the party through three elections , each higher than the last : in the 1999 legislative elections the party got 7.4% of the vote , in the 2002 legislative elections it got 9.5% of the vote , and in the 2006 legislative elections the party got 11.05% of the vote . After losses in the 2008 legislative elections , in which the Green Partys voteshare dropped to 10.11% , Van der Bellen , dubbed the green professor by the media , resigned on 3 October 2008 as spokesman of the Green Party . He handed over the office to the Third President of the National Council at the time , Eva Glawischnig . As designated spokesperson she was elected administrative party leader on 24 October and later officially endorsed and sworn in by the party congress ( Bundeskongress ) . Member of parliament . With the beginning of the XIX . legislative period on 7 November 1994 Van der Bellen functioned as a member of the National Council for the first time and held this position until 2012 . During the XXIV . legislative period he dropped out of the National Council on 5 July 2012 . From 1999 to 2008 he was parliamentary leader of the Green Party in the National Council . During his time in the National Council , Van der Bellen also served as a member of the Budget , Main , Science , Financial , Industrial ( as deputy chairman ) , Administrative and Foreign Affairs ( as clerk and deputy chairman ) committees as well as member of several subcommittees . In 2009/10 he was a substitute member and from 2010 to 2012 a member of the Austrian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg . After the 2008 legislative elections , he was proposed by the Greens , who were no longer the third strongest party , as a counter-candidate to the controversial FPÖ candidate Martin Graf for the post of Third President of the National Council , however , he failed to win the vote on 28 October 2008 : Graf was elected with 109 out of 156 valid votes , Van der Bellen only received 27 , and the remaining 20 votes went to other MPs . University commissioner . On February 2011 , Van der Bellen was elected by the red-green city and state government as Commissioner for Universities and Research ( also : Commissioner of the City of Vienna for Universities and Research , denotation in 2013 ) . While he himself volunteered this activity , in addition to his still exercised National Council mandate , the new infrastructure office for him with a budget of 210,000 euros annually was endowed . As a university commissioner , he campaigned for the improvement of the relationship between the city of Vienna and the universities located there . At his initiative , regular meetings took place for the first time between representatives of the Viennese universities and the Municipal Department 35 ( Municipal Department of the City of Vienna ) in order to improve cooperation in immigration and residence matters for third-country students and researchers . The initiative was taken up by the Austrian Universities Conference - The Austrian Conference of Rectors ( uniko ) and extended from Vienna to the whole of Austria . On the initiative of University Commissioner Van der Bellen , the Vienna University Circle , an informal advisory board composed of rectors and vice-rectors of Viennese universities , including the research institution Institute of Science and Technology Austria ( IST Austria ) , were launched . Vienna state parliament . At the 2010 Viennese state elections on 10 October Van der Bellen stood as a candidate on the 29th place of the list of the Vienna Greens . With the elections slogan Go Professor go ! he reached 11,952 preferred votes and thus achieved a precedence on the first place . Although he stated in multiple interviews : Should I get the preferential votes and it comes to a red-green government , I will definitely move into the Landtag , he still did not accept the Gemeinderat mandate after the elections and remained in the National Council til 5 July 2012 . On 14 June 2012 , Van der Bellen announced in a press conference to swap from the National Council to the Vienna Gemeinderat and Landtag . On 5 July 2012 he left the National Council . The inauguration took place in September 2012 at the first Gemeinderat meeting after the summer break . In January 2015 , it was announced that Van der Bellen would retreat from Viennas municipal politics at the end of the legislative period . In the internal list election of the Vienna Greens on 14 February , after the application deadline , he did not compete in the internal party candidacy . Thus he was no longer on a selectable place on the electoral lists of the Greens in the 2015 Viennese state elections . Political views . In 2001 , Van der Bellen said that he turned from an arrogant anti-capitalist into a broad-minded left-liberal over the course of his political career . In his 2015 autobiography , Van der Bellen described himself as a liberal positioned in the political centre while downplaying his earlier description as left-liberal , and said he was inspired by the Anglo-Saxon liberal tradition , particularly John Stuart Mill . He is strongly supportive of the European Union , and advocates European federalism . During the 2016 presidential election , he appealed to the political centre and used Unser Präsident der Mitte ( Our President of the Centre ) for his campaign slogan . Van der Bellen has argued that Europe should accept refugees who have fled to Europe from war zones in Syria and elsewhere , and has often mentioned his own background as the son of refugees in debates . He has opposed the governments decision to impose a limit on how many asylum-seekers it will allow into Austria . Van der Bellen has commented that due to emerging Islamophobia and prejudice against women wearing headscarves , he could foresee a day when all non-Muslim women might also be asked to wear headscarves as a sign of solidarity with women who wear them on religious grounds . The remarks were criticized widely , especially on the political right . Van der Bellen has criticized U.S . President Donald Trump , warning of the dangers of right-wing populism . He has opined that the British withdrawal from the European Union is damaging to the economies of both the United Kingdom and Europe . He is opposed to recognising the Russian annexation of Crimea . He has stated that the Austrian embassy in Israel should remain in Tel Aviv . Van der Bellen has criticized Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his supporters after mass pro-Erdoğan protests by Turks in Austria , saying : In Austria there is freedom to demonstrate as long as it is peaceful . [ ... ] Everyone that accepts the right to demonstrate , has to see that the same rights – such as freedom of speech , press freedom , independent justice system , and freedom to demonstrate are being denied in Turkey by President Erdogan . Presidential election . Before the election . Since August 2014 Van der Bellen has already been regarded as a presidential candidate . The Green Party reserved the domain vdb2016.at through the media agency Media Brothers for a possible presidential candidacy of Van der Bellen in November 2014 . After its reservation the party delegated the domain to the Association Together for Van der Bellen as of 6 January 2016 . Campaign . On 8 January 2016 , Van der Bellen officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election by video message . Van der Bellen ran as an independent candidate and thus non-party nominee for the office of President . As the longest-serving leader of the Green party ( from 1997 to 2008 ) and as an afterwards still active party member , Van der Bellens claimed nonpartisanism was questioned and challenged throughout his presidential campaign . However , Van der Bellen officially suspended his party membership at the Greens as of 23 May 2016 , demonstrating his willingness to strive for a nonpartisan incumbency . Regardless of that the Green Party still supported him during his campaign ; establishing the Association Together for Van der Bellen – Independent Initiative for the 2016 Presidential Election which comprised six employees and premises as well as 1.2 million euros financial aid . The association is headquartered within the Green Partys head office , executive director of the association is Van der Bellens campaign manager Lothar Lockl . For the repetition of the second ballot , the association received a total of 18,398 private donations , which amounted to about 2.7 million euros . In comparison Van der Bellens run-off opponent Norbert Hofer was vested with 3.4 million euros by his party . The Greens however , suspected that this sum only encompassed monetary and no material donations . By running as a non-partisan candidate , Van der Bellen could also avoid an official requirement for approval of the Green Party Congress , therefore discussions about the party basis as well as a possible non-unanimous voting result were bypassed . As an independent candidate , it would legally not have been necessary for him to disclose the campaign donations . Nevertheless , the Association Together for Van der Bellen still published them on their website . Election . In the first round of the 2016 presidential election , Van der Bellen ranked second with 21.34% of the votes being behind Norbert Hofer with 35.05% . In the second round of voting ( the runoff election ) on 22 May 2016 , the provisional final result excluding postal votes was : Norbert Hofer with 51.93% and Alexander Van der Bellen with 48.07% . Therefore no winner could be determined on election night . On the following day ( 23 May 2016 ) , Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka announced the final results including postal votes , according to which Van der Bellen received 50.35% and Hofer 49.64% of valid votes . Van der Bellen had a lead of 31,026 votes on Hofer . The voter turnout was 72.7% . The complete final result was announced with a correction ( in a constituency votes were counted twice ) , after which the difference has been reduced to less than 31,000 valid votes between Van der Bellen and Hofer , but this had little effect on the total percentage . ( The changes only affected the third decimal place. ) Following the election , the designated President Van der Bellen reaffirmed his views on the Freedom Party and stated that he would not charge them with the task to form a government , even if they became the largest party . This would have been a novelty in the history of the Second Republic , since so far all Presidents had charged the chairperson of the largest party with the government formation . On 8 June , Freedom Party chairman Heinz-Christian Strache brought in a 150-page notice of appeal to the Constitutional Court , which was intended to highlight deficiencies in the conduct of the second voting round . On 1 July 2016 , the Constitutional Court consented the electoral appeal of the Freedom Party . Because of irregularities that occurred in the counting of postal votes , the election had to be repeated in the whole of Austria . Van der Bellen also won the second runoff election postponed to 4 December 2016 , receiving 53.8% of valid votes ( with a voter turnout of 74.2% ) . While Van der Bellens lead in the run-off vote on May 2016 amounted to barely less than 31,000 votes , he was able to expand his lead in the second run-off vote on December 2016 to over 348,000 valid votes . Inauguration . Alexander Van der Bellen was inaugurated as President of Austria on 26 January 2017 . After his inaugural speech he met with the Kern government and was greeted with a military ceremony as the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesheer . Honours and awards .

On 27 June 2010 , Locke grabbed his first hat-trick in first grade , bagging three tries as the Warriors defeated the Sydney Roosters 20-18 at AMI Stadium in Christchurch .

Locke remained at the club for 2012 after the Warriors exercised an option on his contract . He then signed a contract with the club until the end of the 2014 season . However , Lockes position with the warriors was put under threat by the signing of English fullback Sam Tomkins from Wigan . In May 2014 , Salford Red Devils RLFC of the Super League announced Locke had signed a 3-year deal to play for them , beginning in October 2014 ahead of the 2015 season , having rejected offers from Union clubs Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors . The Red Devils then negotiated his early release from the Warriors , where in 2014 he had languished in the Warriors NSW Cup side with Tomkins preferred in the top grade and he arrived to make his début for the English club during the 2014 season at Huddersfield . Locke scored a try and kicked six goals in a 10-36 win .

Before assuming the top Bundesbank position in 2011 , from February 2006 , he served as Head of Division IV ( Economic and Financial Policy ) in the Federal Chancellery . He was the chief negotiator of the Federal Republic of Germany for both the summits of the G8 and the G20 . Early life and academic career . Weidmann was born in Solingen . In 1987 , Weidmann graduated from gymnasium in Backnang , Baden-Württemberg after which he studied economics at Aix-Marseille University , the University of Paris , and University of Bonn . He received his Diplom in economics in 1993 . From 1993 to 1994 , he commenced his doctoral studies on European monetary policy under the supervision of professor at the University of Mannheim , but later transferred back to Bonn again . He received his Dr . rer . nat . pol . under the auspices of monetary theorist in 1997 . During his studies Weidmann had internships at the Banque de France and the National Bank of Rwanda . Due to the resulting knowledge of the French financing sector his later career in German financial politics was welcomed in France and seen as a support of the Franco-German twin engine . His education has been characterized as specialising in monetarist economics . Professional career . From 1997 to 1999 , Weidmann worked at the International Monetary Fund . Until 2004 he worked as Secretary of the German Council of Economic Experts . During his time at the Council , he played a key role in compiling a 20-point plan for boosting growth and employment that formed the basis of then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s Agenda 2010 reforms . From there he moved to the Bundesbank , where until 2006 he was the head of the Monetary Policy and Monetary Analysis group . Advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel , 2006-2011 . In 2006 , Weidmann began working at the Federal Chancellery , where he was responsible for preparing the content and strategy of the G-20 round which was formed to counter the effects of the financial crisis . When he started , he was the youngest department head in the German government . Chancellor Angela Merkel promoted him in December 2009 to the influential role of the Sherpa of the G8 summits as she considers the G8 round to be only a pre-summit of the G20 round in the field of the world-wide financial system as well as that most other subjects need a wider context than the G8 as well ( compare Heiligendamm Process for G8+5 ) . During his time at the Federal Chancellery , Weidmann was involved in a series of major decisions in response to the financial crisis in Germany and Europe : preventing the meltdown of the bank Hypo Real Estate , guaranteeing German deposits and implementing a rescue programme for the banking system , piecing together two fiscal-stimulus programmes , and setting up the Greek bail-out package and the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) . In 2011 , Weidmann suggested to Merkel that the position of Bundesbank vice president , which had also become vacant , be filled by Sabine Lautenschläger , then director of Germanys Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) . President of the Bundesbank , 2011–present . In February , 2011 , Weidmann was designated to succeed Axel A . Weber as president of the Deutsche Bundesbank . In September , with the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis , Weidmann was observed by a British commentator , David Marsh , to be taking a cool course relative to Chancellor Merkel . Marsh wrote that Weidmann was saying the European Monetary Union ( EMU ) has to go in one of two directions . Either it takes the path of a fiscal union in which member countries fuse together their economic and financial systems into a much more robust framework that will protect them from internal dislocation . Weidmann says , coolly , this is somewhat unlikely . Or EMU remains a looser grouping of countries that will face the discipline of the financial markets if they fail to produce economic convergence , namely exit from the EMU and default , looking particularly at Greece . Marsh also noted that Merkel is committed to the first course and so may come into conflict with her one-time economic adviser Weidmann . In a late November , 2011 , speech in Berlin , Weidmann criticized the errors and many years of wrong developments of the EMUs peripheral states , particularly the wasted opportunity represented by their disproportionate investment in private home-building , high government spending or private consumption , David Marsh reported . In early December , with another in a string of Eurozone summits imminent , Bloomberg commented that the new ECB head Mario Draghi knows he cant afford to repeat his predecessor Jean-Claude Trichets mistake of alienating the Bundesbank . Draghi was said in the report to be courting Weidmann by , among others , Julian Callow , chief European economist at Barclays in London . In May , 2012 , Weidmanns stance was characterized by US economist and columnist Paul Krugman as amounting to wanting to destroy the Euro . Weidmann , in late August 2012 , was reported to have threatened to resign as Draghis July 2012 promise to do whatever it takes to save the Euro seemed likely to lead to purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds to keep interest rates in those major member economies capped at manageable levels . In an interview with Der Spiegel last week , Weidmann said the bond buying made it look as if ECB was financing governments directly — and shouldn’t go ahead , reported another MarketWatch commentator , Matthew Lynn . Lynn further speculated on the Draghi-Weidmann interaction , reminding readers of Axel Webers 2011 resignation over a similar [ ECB ] scheme and also of the 1992 failure of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism over German refusal to choose printing money ( taking some small risks with inflation ) .. . to stabilize the system . On 24 February 2016 , as part of the Bundesbanks annual news conference , Bundesbank president and European Central Bank Governing Council member , Jens Weidmann , dismissed deflation in light of the ECBs current stimulus program , pointing out the healthy condition of the German economy and that the euro area is not that bad off , on the eve of the 9–10 March 2016 meetings . In April 2019 , Weidmanns mandate as Bundesbank president was renewed for another eight years . Other activities .

In early December , with another in a string of Eurozone summits imminent , Bloomberg commented that the new ECB head Mario Draghi knows he cant afford to repeat his predecessor Jean-Claude Trichets mistake of alienating the Bundesbank . Draghi was said in the report to be courting Weidmann by , among others , Julian Callow , chief European economist at Barclays in London . In May , 2012 , Weidmanns stance was characterized by US economist and columnist Paul Krugman as amounting to wanting to destroy the Euro . Weidmann , in late August 2012 , was reported to have threatened to resign as Draghis July 2012 promise to do whatever it takes to save the Euro seemed likely to lead to purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds to keep interest rates in those major member economies capped at manageable levels . In an interview with Der Spiegel last week , Weidmann said the bond buying made it look as if ECB was financing governments directly — and shouldn’t go ahead , reported another MarketWatch commentator , Matthew Lynn . Lynn further speculated on the Draghi-Weidmann interaction , reminding readers of Axel Webers 2011 resignation over a similar [ ECB ] scheme and also of the 1992 failure of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism over German refusal to choose printing money ( taking some small risks with inflation ) .. . to stabilize the system . - Curriculum Vitae , Bundesbank webpage ( 2012-09-05 ) .</p><p>pred_time: </p><p>groundtruth: Deutsche Bundesbank</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-122"/wiki/Svetogorsk#P17#2</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Svetogorsk#P17#2<p>context: Svetogorsk Svetogorsk ( ; ) is an industrial town in Vyborgsky District of Leningrad Oblast , Russia , located on the Karelian Isthmus , on the Vuoksi River . It is located from the Finnish–Russian border , from the Finnish town of Imatra , and from St . Petersburg . Population : History . Originally called Enso , the town was founded in 1887 to serve a paper mill . At the time , Enso was part of Viipuri Province and the Jääski Municipality in the Grand Duchy of Finland , which was an autonomic state within the Russian Empire . When Finland became independent in 1917 , Enso remained part of Finland . The territory was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty as a result of the Winter War . After the Winter War , the Finns and the Soviets disagreed on the interpretation of the peace treaty regarding Enso . The former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland Väinö Tanner wrote in his memoirs : Already now a dispute about the district of Enso developed . According to the map attached to the peace treaty Enso was clearly intended to belong to Finland but the Russians claimed that it should belong to them . Later the map was redrawn according to the interests of the Russians so that the border bends at Enso . In March 1940 , Enso became a part of Yaskinsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Yaski . It was a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic , after March 31 , 1940 of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic . Enso was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during the Continuation War but was again ceded to Soviets by the Moscow Armistice . This secession was formalized after signing the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947 . The Finnish population was resettled to Finland , while migrants from Central Russia resettled the Karelian Isthmus . On November 24 , 1944 , Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish SSR to Leningrad Oblast . On October 1 , 1948 , the district was renamed Lesogorsky and on January 13 , 1949 , all Finnish names of the localities were replaced with Russian names . In particular , Enso was renamed Svetogorsk . On December 9 , 1960 , Lesogorsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District . In 1972 , the Soviet Union awarded Finland a construction project for a large new cellulose and paper mill in Svetogorsk . The project was paid with Soviet crude oil . The project also gave a start to cross-border relations . Notably , the construction workers in Svetogorsk were called builders , and the project also had intent to build friendship between peoples . On April 18 , 2008 , about five hundred inhabitants of Svetogorsk participated in a protest which included a road barricade on the Finnish–Russian border as a protest against poor road conditions and lack of investment in road improvement at both federal and municipal level . According to the Finnish public service broadcaster Yle , the militia participated in effectively cutting off through traffic . The main issue of discontent was the lack of a bypass , which , according to reports , should have already been built . Administrative and municipal status . Within the framework of administrative divisions , it is , together with the urban-type settlement of Lesogorsky and two rural localities , incorporated within Vyborgsky District as Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation . As a municipal division , Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Vyborgsky Municipal District as Svetogorskoye Urban Settlement . Economy . Industry . Before the Winter War , the town was a major factory site for Enso-Gutzeit Oy , the Finnish pulp and paper company ( now Stora Enso ) . In the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty , the new Finnish-Soviet border was deliberately drawn to leave the factory complex on the Soviet side . The towns major industry is still pulp and paper . OAO Svetogorsk , one of the biggest paper mills in Russia , is the major employer . Covering , OAO Svetogorsk produces pulp , printing paper , and packaging board . Its brands include Svetocopy and Ballet office paper . Since December 1998 , OAO Svetogorsk has been majority owned by International Paper . At end of 2001 , the plant employed 3,000 people ; by 2008 this had fallen to 2,200 . Immediately adjacent to OAO Svetogorsk is a tissue mill . This formed part of the original mill complex but was split-away and resold by International Paper to SCA during the acquisition of OAO Svetogorsk from Tetra Laval , which controlled the plant since 1995 . Svetogorsk Tissue , as the separate entity was to be called , became fully integrated into SCA Hygiene Products Division in 2003 ( called Essity since 2017 ) . It employs around four hundred people . Its products include Zewa and Tork brands of paper towels and toilet paper . Border crossing . The Imatra–Svetogorsk border crossing plays a key role in the transportation of timber between Russia and Finland . Also , around 150 employees commute daily from Imatra to the paper mills . The border crossing , which had temporary status , was a bottleneck causing frequent delays due to lengthy customs checks and inadequate facilities . A Russia-Finland agreement in 1997 allowed the development and eventual permanence of the border crossing . This €7 million European Union TACIS-funded project ran from 1999 and the new international frontier , capable of handling 1,300 cars per day , opened on July 3 , 2002 . Transportation . Svetogorsk is connected by railway with Kamennogorsk , where it has connection to the old Vyborg–Joensuu railroad . There is suburban traffic to Vyborg . The continuation of the railroad beyond Svetogorsk to the Finnish–Russian border is disused . Svetogorsk is connected by roads with Kamennogorsk and Vyborg , as well as with Imatra across the border .

The Black Eye ) is a German role-playing game created by Ulrich Kiesow and launched by Schmidt Spiel &amp; Freizeit GmbH and Droemer Knaur Verlag in 1984 . It is the most successful role-playing game on the German market , outselling Dungeons &amp; Dragons . Many years of work on the game have led to a detailed and extensively-described game world . Droemer Knaur dropped the project in early 1989 ; after the bankruptcy of the Schmidt Spiel &amp; Freizeit GmbH in 1997 , publishing was continued by Fantasy Productions ( which had already done all the editorial work ) . Since the games launch , the game has gone through five editions , making the rules and background more complex . The basic rules of the fourth edition of The Dark Eye were published in 2001 , and was the first edition to be released in English ( in October 2003 ) . The fifth edition of the game was released in August 2015 , with an English translation released in November 2016 . Aventuria ( the continent on which the game is set ) was first introduced to the English-language market through a series of computer games and novels and later under the name Realms of Arkania . The trademark Realms of Arkania was owned by the now-defunct Sir-tech Software , Inc. , which spurred the name change to The Dark Eye ; Fantasy Productions was unable to obtain the trademark . In April 2007 , Ulisses Spiele assumed the TDE pen-and-paper licence from Fantasy Productions . Game history . First edition ( 1984 ) . The German first edition ( 1984 ) was translated into Dutch ( ) , French ( ) and Italian ( ) , but not into English . It has a very simple class and level system . It was published in ( The Dark Eye—Adventure Base Game ) . Advanced rules were published in 1985 in the book ( Extended adventure—Additional equipment for all adventures ) . Character . The character ( called Hero in the rules ) is defined by five qualities ( or attributes ) : ( courage ) , ( wisdom ) , ( same ) , ( agility ) and ( strength ) . They are determined by 1d6+7 in dice notation ( 8–13 ) . The weight the character can carry is equal to strength × 100 ounces ( 1 aventurian ounce is 25 g ) . The player can choose five different character types ( or classes ) : adventurer , warrior , dwarf , elf and mage . All characters can be adventurers , but there are attribute conditions to access the other types ( for example , a warrior must have at least 12 in both courage and strength ) . During the adventures , the character gains adventure points ; with a sufficient number of adventure points , they can go to the next level . When attaining a new level the character can increase an attribute by one point , and either the attack or parry value by one point ; they also win vitality points equal to one dice roll , or vitality or astral energy points equal to one dice roll for elves and mages . The extended rules add a sixth quality to the heros definition : stamina . The initial stamina is the sum of the force and vitality points . Stamina represents resistance to exhaustion ; it decreases when the hero makes physical efforts such as running , swimming and fighting . The extended rules also provide four more classes that can be chosen during the creation of the character , or sometimes as an evolution of an adventurer or dwarf : rider , druid , priest or wood elf . It introduces the aptitudes ( skills ) that are chances to manage definite actions ( such as horseback riding or camouflage ) , whereas the qualities are generic indicators . The aptitudes range between 0 and 18 ( and are tested with a d20 in dice notation ) . They have a base value ( some are part of the culture , or are simple tasks ) . When the character reaches a new level , the player can distribute 10 points to raise the aptitudes . The base value and the cost to increase depend on the type of hero ( riding is easier for a warrior than for a mage ) ; the cost also depends on the current aptitude level . Health . The character type determines the starting value of vitality points ( from 20 for a mage to 35 for a dwarf ) . This is to be compared with the 1d6+4 ( dice notation ) damage points inflicted by a sword . In the extended rules , stamina plays a role in the healing of diseases ( such as a fever ) ; when it is 20 or more spontaneous healing is possible , and it is faster when stamina is above 25 . Resolution of actions . Actions are resolved by testing the attributes ; the action succeeds when : The modifier is positive when the action is difficult , and negative when it is easy . The extended rules introduce the aptitudes , which are tested in the same way as the qualities . Combat . In fights , the characters act in decreasing order of initiative ( the character with the highest initiative acts first ) . Characters have attack and parry values determined by various other values . Typical attack/parry values for a new character are in the range of 14/12 ( for fighters ) to something like 6/8 ( dedicated non-fighters , such as priests of the goddess Tsa ) . When the attack test of the attacker is successful and the defender misses the parry test , the defender loses the number of vitality points equal to the damage of the weapon minus the protection rating of the armor ( chain mail has a protection rating of four , and knight armour has six ) . When the attacker rolls one or two on the die , they make a master hit ; the maximum damage is inflicted , and the armour does not protect . The extended rules provide for miniature figures which allow a finer representation of movement , with ( for example ) the possibility to push back an enemy . They also offer various possibilities such as fleeing , charging and successive attacks from the same fighter ( assault ) . They replace the master hit with the notions of good attack ( the attacker makes a throw equal to or less than the good attack score , as shown on a table in relation to her attack score ) and good parry ( five points less than the parry score with the d20 in dice notation ) . A good attack not parried by a good parry implies a serious ( or critical ) impact ( throw 1d20 and read the result on a table ) . When the attack or parry-test die shows 20 , this can lead to a fumble . The extended rules also allow dodging thrown weapons , introduce specific rules for empty-hand and horseback fighting and infection ( fever ) for wounds . Magic . Elves , druids , shamans , witches and mages can cast spells and have astral energy points ; the starting value of astral energy points depends on the attribute values the hero has when created . The system is based on the memory of the player ; the player must speak the formula without reading it during the game . When the formula is correct the spell is cast , and the character loses astral energy points corresponding to the spell . The extended rules introduce new spells . From the fifth level on , it is no longer necessary to speak the words to cast the spell . These rules also describe spells for the druids and wood elves , and priests miracles : manifestations of the priests god , which are similar to magic spells . The priests do not have astral energy but karma , which works the same way . First-edition advanced rules ( The Sword Masters , 1988 ) . Two sets , ( TDE Professional—Sword Masters Set I ) and ( TDE Professional II—The Sword Masters Feast ) , were published in 1988 and 1989 . This edition was published as advanced rules for the first edition , but is sometimes erroneously considered the second edition . Combat rules are much more elaborate , introducing a hit-location system . It was written for advanced-level characters ( typically level 15 ) . The sets describe a new world : Tharun ( pronounced taroon ) , a hollow world . It is the inside of Ethra , lightened by a central sun . Nine archipelagos constitute the realm of this world . A pantheon of nine deities rules over the inhabitants . Divine runes ( one of the only sources of magic which can be used by magicians and druids ) are scattered all over the world . The sets also provide a divine quest . A third set of campaigns was planned , but has not been released . The Tharun setting was abandoned , but it is said that the world and its pantheon still exist ; some deities are worshiped in Myranor . Second edition ( 1988 ) . The second edition was published in 1988 . The character is defined by the same five positive attributes ( qualities ) as in the first edition , as well as five new negative ones : ( superstition ) , ( acrophobia ) , ( claustrophobia ) , ( avarice ) and ( necrophobia ) . The positive attributes are determined by 1d6+7 in dice notation ( 8–13 ) , and the negative by 1d6+1 ( 2–7 ) . The player can choose from over 40 different character types ( classes ) . Again , there are attributes ( conditions ) to access the types . A character also features over 80 skills , called talents ; the use of a talent requires testing three attributes , and the character is able to cast over 100 ( 11×11 ) spells . Third edition and Realms of Arkania ( 1993 ) . The third edition ( 1993 ) was used ( with a few limitations ) to power the three Realms of Arkania computer games : ( 1993 ) , Attic/Sir-Tech ) , ( 1994 , Attic/Sir-Tech ) and ( 1997 , Attic/Sir-Tech ) . Realms of Arkania was also the name of three translated novels : RoA : The Charlatan ( January 1996 , ) , RoA : The Lioness ( March 1996 , ) and RoA : The Sacrifice ( September 1996 , ) . The rules are similar to the second edition except for two additional positive attributes : ( dexterity ) and ( intuition ) ; and two additional negative attributes : ( curiosity ) and ( violent temper ) . The character is thus defined by seven positive and seven negative attributes ( qualities ) , and this edition uses the same system of talents . Fourth edition ( 2001 ) . The fourth edition of The Dark Eye supports a great variety of character choices . Where the older editions forced the player to create a character along very strict lines , the fourth edition is flexible and the player can choose from hundreds of different character classes and cultural backgrounds . The creation rules are somewhat similar to those of Shadowrun ( also published by Fantasy Productions ) and even more to GURPS . One reason for this development is the large community of professional authors and enthusiastic players , which have helped to define the continent of Aventuria over the last 20 years . Character generation is based on “generation points” from which a race , a culture and a profession must be “paid” . The points are also used for attributes and other skills . After generation , the gained “adventure points” for each adventure can be used for equipping the character with skills . Consequently , the systems intends to balance power levels of different character classes . The fourth edition was also translated into English . Three books are available in English ( all published 2006 ) : - Basic Rules ( ) - Secret of the Blue Tower / Witching Hour ( ) - World of Aventuria ( ) Fifth edition ( 2015 ) . Ulisses started development of the fifth edition in the beginning of 2014 . Its development involved a players poll and parts of the publishers internet forum are dedicated to that topic . The beta version ( in German ) was released 10 May 2014 and can be freely downloaded . The final German version is available as of 31 July 2015 . The publisher also created a website concerning the progress of the English version . The English translation was released in November 2016 . Setting . Aventuria . The Dark Eye is set in the fantasy realm of Aventuria . During the 1990s , it was first translated as Arkania , but the name was later changed to one closer to the original German name . Aventuria is a continent of the planet Ethra ( an anagram of Earth , as the planets name in the German edition , Dere , is an anagram of , the German word for Earth ) . The other continents of Ethra are Myranor ( also called Gyldenland in Aventuria ) , Uthuria and Vaestenland . Tharun . Tharun was envisioned as the inner side of Ethra , which was supposed to be a hollow world . It is lit by a central sun which also annihilates the usual magic . In todays ingame theory Tharun is a so-called Globule , a place in another Sphere of reality – or an alternate dimension ( although this explanation is very simplified ) . The original sun , Glost , was the work of Guerimm , the god of fire . New gods appeared and started to oppose the twelve gods of Aventuria . One of them , ArkanZim , destroyed Glost , and another new god , Sindayri , created a new sun , aiming to reduce the influence of the twelve gods in the hollow world . The splinters of Glost were spread everywhere . The inhabitants picked them and drew runes on them . They thus became runestones ; the combination of three runestones can lead to the liberation of the energy of Glost , allowing a new magic . Tharun is linked to the surface of Ethra by a double-sided volcano . The upper side is on an island 1,400 km west from Havena , the other side is upside down , and is situated in Tharun on the isle of Hamur . The society is a military dictatorship , with a caste of Sword Masters ruling the rest of the population . Myranor . Myranor or Gyldenland ( In the original , meaning Golden country ) is a large continent west of Aventuria . It was first described in 1990 and released as a separate RPG in 2000 . Initially , it was used to play-test an early version of what came to be The Dark Eye 4th edition rules . In contrast to Aventuria , the setting is high fantasy . There are gigantic Metropolis , flying ships and cities , several races unknown to aventurians including cat-like humanoids and intelligent insects , as well as a country leached by its vampire-like , skull god Draydalān worshiping population . The continent is huge and parts of it still are unexplored . While most of Aventuria is set in the central European Middle Ages , Myranor is based on a mixture of classic Greek/Roman as well as medieval Asian background . One notable political structure is a huge empire that has been in degeneration for millennia . At its height , it had been the origin of modern civilization in Aventuria , and the area it still controls is larger than Aventuria itself . In its early years , the empire was controlled by mighty three-eyed wizards called the old ones , who disappeared thousands of years ago . After its initial release in 2000 , only one additional rule book , one regional description and six adventures were released . After those , nothing further was released for Myranor . Two fans , however , revised Myranor to be played with the final 4th edition rules with FanPros permission . These new rules were released as a hardcover book in January 2006 . On 20 January 2007 Ulisses Spiele announced that they would be handling future publications related to Myranor . Creatures . Humans . There are three human groups , and several smaller cultures : - Middenrealmers : from Gyldenland , they landed on the west coast and spread to the centre of Aventuria . - Andergastans ( template : ) - Bornlanders ( template : Russia at the end of the Middle Ages ) - Cyclopeans ( template : Ancient Greece and Roman Empire ) - Horasians ( template : Italy and France , between the Baroque and the Renaissance ) - Maraskans ( template : Asia—an amalgam of Middenrealers and Tulamydes ) - Middenrealmers ( template : Germany or rather the German Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages ) - Northern-Aventurians ( template : ) - Nostrians ( template : ) - Southern-Aventurians ( template : ) - Svellters ( template : ) - Tulamydes : natives of Aventuria , probably from the Rashtul Wall ; they spread to the south of Aventuria ; - Mhanadistanians ( template : caricature of the golden age of Arab civilisation ) - Novadis ( template : Tuareg ) : nomadic people of the desert of Khom ; - Thorwalians ( template : vikings ) : coming from Hjaldingard in Gyldenland , they settled in northwest Aventuria - Norbards ( template : petty , travelling east-European traders ) : an amalgam of Middenrealers and Tulamydes - Smaller groups , all indigenous to Aventuria : - Nivese ( template : Sami ) - Forest Folk and Utulus , collectively called Mohas ( template : Indigenous peoples of the Americas ) Elves . - Forest Elves : fairy-like elves , living mostly in a large wood called the Salamander Stones . They are worldly yet innocent , and dislike humans . - Firn Elves : live in the north , in perpetual ice ; for them , life is a hard struggle . - Meadow Elves : live throughout the northern half of Aventuria along rivers ; open-minded , they sometimes live in human cities . - Veld Elves : horsemen from the grasslands of northeast Aventuria ; they have loose contact with humans and Goblins . The Elves are indigenous cultures , and generally do not believe in gods . Unbeknownst to most Elves , Firn , Meadow and Veld Elves once had a single common culture ( like that of Tolkiens elves ) . Dwarves . - Ore Dwarves : conservative , concerned with etiquette - Anvil Dwarves : aggressive and stubborn - Brilliant Dwarves : artistic - Hill Dwarves : similar to Tolkiens Hobbits , but here considered Dwarves Other . - Ogres : giants of great strength , these simple-minded , strong creatures are often found in the company of Orcs , swinging large wooden clubs lopped off trees . Common to all Ogres is the consumption of nearly everything they encounter . - Orks : black-coated , monkey-like species native to the veld ( ork land ) in northwest Aventuria , with a culture similar to the Orcs of Warcraft - Holberker : a mix between elves and orcs , found only in few areas - Goblins : smaller relatives of the Orks , with red-brown fur , living mostly in northeastern Aventuria . Goblins are second in numbers only to the humans . - Achaz : lizard-men , whose ancient culture is now destroyed - Trolls : large , burly creatures living in the Troll Mountains . Intelligent , they hint at an ancient trollish civilization predating every other .

Life . Gzovskaya was born to a family of a Moscow customs official of Polish origin . In 1905 , she graduated from the Imperial Drama School at the Maly Theatre , having studied under Aleksandr Pavlovich Lensky . On 1 September 1905 she joined the Maly Theatre troupe , with the first role of Ariel in The Tempest by William Shakespeare , that October . From 1905 to 1908 , she appeared at the Maly Theatre . In 1907 , she met Konstantin Stanislavski at a summer resort and began taking private acting lessons from him . During their classes Stanislavski commented to Gzovskaya that she should perform at the Moscow Art Theatre , which she took as an offer of employment and quit the Maly . As the board had not been consulted , the engagement by the Moscow Art Theatre became contentious and she was forced to tour throughout Russia during the 2008-2009 season . Her employment was also complicated because her fiancé , who was working at the Maly , was trying to become the manager of the Moscow Art Theatre , but the theater did not trust his reputation . In July 1908 , she and Nelidov married . Gzovskaya returned to the Maly for the 1909-1910 season , but in 1910 , she moved to the Moscow Art Theatre .

As the board had not been consulted , the engagement by the Moscow Art Theatre became contentious and she was forced to tour throughout Russia during the 2008-2009 season . Her employment was also complicated because her fiancé , who was working at the Maly , was trying to become the manager of the Moscow Art Theatre , but the theater did not trust his reputation . In July 1908 , she and Nelidov married . Gzovskaya returned to the Maly for the 1909-1910 season , but in 1910 , she moved to the Moscow Art Theatre . In 1912 , she performed a series of engagements in Prague , but was primarily engaged until 1917 at the Moscow Art Theater . Between 1917 and 1919 Gzovskaya returned to the Maly .

Open Cup : 2013</p><p>question: Which team did the player John Thorrington belong to from 1999 to 2001?</p><p>pred: Bayer Leverkusen</p><p>context_time: Although raised in the United States , Thorrington started his career as a youth team player in England with Premier League side Manchester United . In 1999 , he moved to Germany and signed with Bayer Leverkusen , however he failed to make the first team with either club and returned to England , where he signed for Huddersfield Town . He went on to feature for Grimsby Town as well before moving to the United States where he signed with Chicago Fire in 2005 . Thorrington attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Peninsula , California . Thorrington was the CIF-SS Division V Player of the Year in 1996 and 1997 . After his junior year of high school and while playing for the Pateadores , Thorrington was spotted by an Englishman , Steve Kelly , who had connections to Manchester United , and Kelly got Thorrington a trial at Manchester United . At the age of 17 , Thorrington signed with Manchester United in 1997 . Later , he moved to Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen . After his time in Germany , he spent a short spell on trial with Bolton Wanderers in the 2000–2001 season . After failing to make a first-team appearance with Manchester United and Leverkusen , Thorrington signed with Huddersfield Town in the summer of 2001 on a free transfer . Huddersfield had recently suffered relegation to the third tier of English soccer and were managed by former Manchester United player Lou Macari . Macari handed Thorrington his full professional debut on August 11 , 2001 in a 1-0 league victory over A.F.C . Bournemouth . He scored his first Town goal September 2 , 2001 in a 2-1 victory over Wycombe Wanderers .

Early life . The son of Civil Service Permanent Secretary Sir Richard Clarke , Charles Clarke was born in London . He attended the fee-paying Highgate School where he was Head Boy . He then read Mathematics and Economics at Kings College , Cambridge , where he also served as the President of the Cambridge Students Union . A member of the Broad Left faction , he was President of the National Union of Students from 1975 to 1977 . Clarke had joined the Labour Party by then and was active in the Clause Four group . Clarke was the British representative on the Permanent Commission for the World Youth Festival ( Cuba ) from 1977 to 1978 . Local government . He was elected as a local councillor in the London Borough of Hackney , being Chair of its Housing Committee and Vice Chair of economic development from 1980 to 1986 . He worked as a researcher , and later Chief of Staff , for Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock from February 1981 to 1992 . His long association with Kinnock and with the general election defeat in 1992 was expected to handicap him in his career , but Clarke bounced back . He spent the mid-1990s away from national politics , working in the private sector – from 1992 to 1997 , he was chief executive of Quality Public Affairs , a public affairs management consultancy – and subsequently emerged as a high flyer under the Labour leadership of Tony Blair . Member of Parliament . Elected to the British House of Commons in the Labour landslide of 1997 , Clarke served just over a year on the back benches , before joining the government as a junior education minister in July 1998 . He moved to the Home Office in 1999 , and joined the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio and Party Chair after the 2001 general election . Education Secretary . He returned to Education as Secretary of State on 24 October 2002 , after the resignation of Estelle Morris . As Education Secretary , he defended Oxbridge , encouraged the establishment of specialist secondary schools , and allegedly suggested that the state should not fund unproductive humanities research . In 2003 , he said in a speech to University College , Worcester : Universities exist to enable the British economy and society to deal with the challenges posed by the increasingly rapid process of global change . He explained : He also oversaw the introduction of Bills to enable universities in parts of Britain to charge top-up fees , despite a Labour manifesto commitment that it would not introduce such fees and indeed had legislated to prevent them . Home Secretary . Following the first resignation of David Blunkett on 15 December 2004 , Clarke was appointed Home Secretary , one of the senior positions in the Cabinet . He was swiftly at the centre of attention for his advocacy of proposals for countering terrorism . Critics suggest that his reforms to the judicial system undermine centuries of British legal precedent dating back to the 1215 Magna Carta , particularly the right to a fair trial and trial by jury . He was also criticised for the Identity Cards Act 2006 , seen by some as serious infringement of privacy , but Clarke insisted that identity cards were necessary to combat terrorism . During the 2005 British Presidency of the European Union , Clarke pressed other member states to pass a directive to require communications data to be stored for law enforcement purposes . The directive was criticised as infringing civil liberties and privacy , and critics also noted that the directive had been approved very quickly . In 2006 , Clarke scrapped an ex-gratia discretionary scheme under which compensation to those wrongly convicted of a criminal offence could be awarded . Professor John Spencer QC , of Cambridge University described the move as monstrous . Foreign prisoners scandal . On 25 April 2006 it emerged that 1,023 foreign prisoners had been freed without being considered for deportation . Among the offenders , five had been convicted of committing sex offences against children , seven had served time for other sex offences , 57 for violent offences and two for manslaughter . There were also 41 burglars , 20 drug importers , 54 convicted of assault and 27 of indecent assault . Former Home Secretary David Blunkett supported Clarke but said that heads should roll over the scandal , though many of the releases had occurred during his period as Home Secretary . The Home Office later stated that 288 were released from prison between August 2005 and March 2006 , which implied that prisoners continued to be released after the matter had been brought to the attention of the government . Out of government . The foreign prisoners scandal led many to call for Clarkes resignation , not only from the opposition ; Clarke reportedly offered to resign , but Tony Blair , the Prime Minister , refused to accept . However , in the wake of a poor Labour performance in the local council elections of 4 May 2006 , Clarke was dismissed in the biggest cabinet upheaval in the history of the Blair governments , to be replaced by Defence Secretary John Reid . Having reputedly turned down the offer of Defence Secretary by Tony Blair , Clarke became a backbencher . At the end of June 2006 , he did a series of interviews in which he criticised John Reid for claiming that the Home Office was unfit for purpose , and that the Prime Minister ought to have defended him to enable him to continue seeing through the reforms he had initiated when first appointed to the post . However , he did state that although Tony Blair had lost his sense of purpose , he wanted to see Blair continue as PM . In September 2006 , Clarke took up a consultancy post with a leading London law firm , leading to speculation he anticipated not returning to frontline politics . Labour leadership controversy . On 8 September 2006 , Clarke gave an interview to the Evening Standard in which he criticised the presumption that Gordon Brown would succeed Tony Blair as Prime Minister , helping trigger further disputes about the Labour leadership . Clarke said of Browns reaction to the leadership crisis , A lot of people are very upset and cross about that . It was absolutely stupid – a stupid , stupid thing to do . He named Alan Milburn as a politician who had the stature to be Prime Minister instead of Brown . Clarke furthered his attack on Brown in an interview with The Daily Telegraph on the following day , accusing Brown of being a control freak , deluded and uncollegiate . Clarke with Alan Milburn set up The 2020 Vision website to discuss the direction of the Labour party after Tony Blair ceased being prime minister . Some observers saw this as a way for Gordon Browns political opponents to create an axis against him . The website has since closed . On 23 March 2008 , Clarke published a list of 35 Labour held constituencies vulnerable to other parties if fewer than 7,500 voters switched parties away from Labour . This was interpreted by many as an attempt to force a leadership change on the Labour party . On 4 September 2008 , Clarke once again attacked Gordon Browns performance as leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister , claiming that he only had months to improve or else should face a leadership contest . However , when asked whether he would stand as a Stalking horse to draw out stronger candidates , he confirmed that he would not . On 1 May 2009 , Clarke joined David Blunkett in criticising Gordon Browns leadership and declared that he was ashamed to be a Labour MP , citing the Damian McBride scandal . In September 2009 , Clarke gave a speech in which he said that Brown should stand down as Prime Minister to help the Labour Party avoid a hammering at the 2010 General Election . Life after Parliament . Clarke lost his Parliamentary seat in the 2010 General Election by a margin of just 300 votes , and declared he was unlikely to stand again for Parliament . On 20 September 2010 , it was announced that Clarke had been appointed Visiting Professor to the School of Political , Social and International Studies at the University of East Anglia . The appointment was part-time and for an initial period of three years . Since November 2010 , Clarke has also been Visiting Professor of Politics and Faith in the Department of Politics , Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University . He is a Council Member of the European Council on Foreign Relations . Clarke is a Senior Network Member at the European Leadership Network ( ELN ) . Too difficult box . Clarke introduced the idea of the too difficult box— an explanation why politicians often opt out of taking action to fix many serious political issues . It is focused on UK politics , but the book suggests that the principles apply to other countries . Clarke originally expounded his ideas in a series of lectures at the University of East Anglia in 2011 . In 2014 , he launched the book The Too Difficult Box : The Big Issues Politicians Cant Crack . The introduction , conclusion and a chapter on immigration is written by Clarke . The rest of the book contains individual chapters ( edited by Clarke ) by past or current politicians or political commentators—each chapter covering a specific political issue considered to be in the too difficult box . Some reasons Clarke gives explaining why politicians find some issues too difficult to deal with are : difficulty identifying the problem ; difficulty identifying the solution ; difficulty working out how to implement a solution ; difficulty overcoming vested interests ; existing legal constraints ; the lengthy process required to bring in legislation ; and a lack of political energy . Personal life . Clarke married Carol Pearson in Hackney , London , in 1984 . They have two sons , both born in Hackney : Christopher Richard Clarke ( born 1987 ) and Matthew Jack Clarke ( born 1990 ) . Previously resident in Norwich , they now live in Cambridge . Clarke speaks Cuban Spanish ( a legacy of his student links with Cuba ) , French , and German . In 2004 , he became a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society to acknowledge its contribution to education and in memory of his father , who had been a statistician . Clarke is an avid supporter of Norwich City Football Club . In July 2018 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law ( DCL ) from the University of East Anglia .

The party maintains a mildly separatist position and campaigns for the self-government of Veneto . The partys founder and long-time leader is Fabrizio Comencini . The LVR emerged in 1998 as a split from Liga Veneta ( LV ) , the national section of Lega Nord in Veneto . Originally named Liga Veneta Repubblica , it changed its name to Veneti dEuropa ( after the merger with Future Veneto in 2000 ) and Liga Fronte Veneto ( after the merger with Fronte Marco Polo in 2001 ) . It finally assumed again the original title in 2007 . In 2000 the party included eight regional councillors , three deputies and four senators ( all LV defectors ) . History . Foundation and early years . In September 1998 , after some clashes with Umberto Bossi , Fabrizio Comencini , national secretary of Liga Veneta ( LV ) since 1994 , tried to lead the party out of Lega Nord ( LN ) , a federation of regional parties . This move was opposed by Bossis loyalists and he was finally expelled from the party and replaced by Gian Paolo Gobbo as leader of the LV . Subsequently , seven out of eight members of LV–LNs group in the Regional Council of Veneto ( Fabrizio Comencini , Ettore Beggiato , Alessio Morosin , Mariangelo Foggiato , Alberto Poirè , Michele Munaretto and Franco Roccon ) left the party and launched Liga Veneta Repubblica ( LVR ) , which was initially intended to be the legal continuation and legitimate heir of the LV . Another councillor , Adriano Bertaso of North-East Union , who had earlier left the LN , joined the party for a while . Comencinis followers represented the more Venetist and separatist wing of the LV , while the people who remained in the LN were mainly fiscal federalists and Padanists . The former were also keen on an alliance with the centre-right Pole of Freedoms coalition in Veneto in support of President Giancarlo Galan , with whom Comencini signed a pact in August 1999 . Despite the entity of the split among elects , most voters of the LV remained loyal to Gobbo and Bossi . In the 1999 European Parliament election the LVR won 3.5% of the vote in Veneto : a good result for a new party , but far less than the LV , which gained a disappointing 10.7% though , and far less than expected . However , the LVR had some local strongholds : San Bonifacio ( 20.9% over LVs 7.0% in 1998 ) , Schio ( 11.8% over 11.1% in 1999 ) , Arcole ( 44.1% over 6.0% in 1999 ) , Camisano Vicentino ( 21.6% over 5.9% in 1999 ) , Creazzo ( 15.5% over 14.7% in 1999 ) , Chiuppano ( 34.8% and elected mayor in 1999 ) , Monticello Conte Otto ( 14.6% over 7.2% in 1999 ) , Resana ( 24.6% over 7.8% in 1999 ) , Spresiano ( 62.2% over 9.1% and elected mayor in 1999 ) and Torri di Quartesolo ( 15.8% in 1999 ) . For the 2000 regional election the LV entered an alliance with the Pole of Freedoms that excluded the LVR . The party , whose name was changed to Veneti dEuropa , won 2.4% ( 0.6% under the threshold needed ) , due to the presence of another Venetist party , Fronte Marco Polo ( 1.2% ) , and an electoral recovery of the LV ( 12.0% ) . The name Veneti dEuropa ( Venetians for Europe ) was chosen as the LVR merged with Future Veneto , member of the Autonomists for Europe , a federation of splinter groups from the LN . Liga Fronte Veneto and split . In 2001 the party , at the time led by the Venetist historian Beggiato , was merged with Fronte Marco Polo into the new Liga Fronte Veneto . Giorgio Vido was elected national secretary and Comencini national president . In 2001 general election Bepin Segato , a separatist activist in jail for having opposed Italian national unity , was a party candidate for the Senate . Despite gaining more than 5.6% of the votes in Veneto ( mainly disgruntled voters of the LN , after the alliance with Silvio Berlusconis Forza Italia ) and more than 10% in several single-seat constituencies , the party was not able to elect any representative to the Italian Parliament . In 2003 Beggiato replaced Vido as national secretary in a time when the party was not represented in the institutions and was shrinking in popular support . In 2004 Beggiato tried to lead the party into North-East Project ( PNE ) , even if PNE leader Giorgio Panto wanted LFV members to join not as a party but as individuals . Comencini ruled out the idea , that would have meant giving up the partys identity . After a tumultuous congress , a group led by Beggiato , Foggiato and Munaretto switched to PNE , while Comencini was elected national secretary and Morosin national president . During this time , the party did occasionally better than the LV in local elections . This was the case of Cittadella in 2002 ( 14.9% over 5.5% ) and San Bonifacio in 2004 ( 17.8% over 4.7% ) : in both cases , LFV candidates , Massimo Bitonci and Silvano Polo respectively , were elected mayors in run-offs . Bitonci , who re-joined the LV , was re-elected in 2007 , while Polo did not stand for re-election and the LFV supported the defeated centre-left candidate . Decline and more splits . In the 2005 regional election the party supported the centre-left candidate for president , Massimo Carraro , winning only 1.2% of the vote , while PNE won 5.4% ( 16.1% in the Province of Treviso ) , and being excluded again from the Regional Council . For the 2006 general election Comencini forged an alliance with The Union coalition led by Romano Prodi , but voters seemed to not like the idea and the party stopped at 0.7% . In the 2007 provincial election of Vicenza the LFV supported Giorgio Carollo , along with parties both from the centre-left and the centre-right : Veneto for the EPP , Italy of Values , UDEUR , Christian Democracy . Carollo scored 9.9% , while the LFV took only 1.6% , compared with 2.3% of PNE and 19.0% of the LV , whose candidate Attilio Schneck was elected President by a landslide . Soon after the election the party returned to its original name , Liga Veneta Repubblica , under which it ran in the 2008 general election . In October 2008 the LVR signed a coalition pact with North-East Project ( PNE ) and Venetian Agreement ( IV ) for the next municipal , provincial and regional elections in order to provide an adequate representation to the Venetian people , in line with what happens in Europe , from Scotland to Catalonia , from Wales to Brittany , where federalist , autonomist and independentist parties , who respond uniquely to their territory , see their popular support increasing . However , in the 2009 provincial and municipal election the LVR chose to support the candidates of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( UDC ) , having its best result in the Province of Padua ( 1.6% ) . For the 2010 regional election , after having formed Veneto Freedom ( VL ) with other Venetist parties , the party finally chose to support Antonio De Poli ( UDC ) for President under the banner of North-East Union ( UNE ) , along with UNE , PNE and IV . This decision caused two splits : the more independentist wing , led by Silvano Polo , joined the new Party of the Venetians ( PdV ) and the left-wing minority faction , led by Bortolino Sartore and Giorgio Vido , formed a new party called Liga Veneto Autonomo ( LVA ) in support of Giuseppe Bortolussi , the centre-left candidate . In the election the list won 1.5% of vote , with peaks of 1.9% and 1.8% in the provinces of Treviso and Belluno , and Mariangelo Foggiato ( PNE ) was elected to the Council .

With the cessation of hostilities , Seed played a Victory League match for Sunderland against Durham City in 1918 , however his lungs were weak and he had a poor game .

Seeds reaction to this was to ask to be released by the club at the end of the 1926–27 season and after looking like taking the player-managers job at Aldershot he eventually signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a part exchange deal involving Darkie Lowdell and a cash adjustment paid by Spurs . Sheffield Wednesday . Seed made his Wednesday debut on 27 August 1927 in the first match of the 1927–28 season against Everton . During the first part of the season Seed was asked to play in numerous different positions by manager Bob Brown as Wednesday struggled in Division One . By mid March 1928 they had won only six matches out of 32 and were seven points adrift at the foot of the table . At that stage Seed was made team captain with existing skipper Fred Keen being dropped , Ellis Rimmer was bought from Tranmere Rovers and these changes triggered an amazing recovery . Wednesday picked up 17 points out of a possible 20 in the last ten matches and avoided relegation by a point . The irony was that it was Seeds old club Tottenham who were relegated on the final day of the season . By his own admission Seed did not play his best football of his career at Wednesday but his experience and know-how as captain was the catalyst that drove a young and talented Wednesday side to two successive Division One championships in the following two seasons ( 1928–29 and 1929–30 ) , making this the most successful period in the clubs history . He played in Sheffield Wednesdays 2–1 defeat by Arsenal in the Charity Shield at Stamford Bridge in October 1930 . Seed played four seasons at Hillsborough but by the 1930–31 season , aged 35 , he was badly hampered by a knee injury and was often limping before the end of the games , he often played even though he was not fully fit because of his talismanic influence on the team . After damaging the ligaments in his right knee in a match against Newcastle United at Christmas 1930 he realised his playing days were numbered , but he didnt retire until the end of the 1931–32 season . He then took up an offer from Herbert Chapman to manage Clapton Orient ( which Chapman intended to become Arsenals nursery club ) . He played for the Professionals in the 1929 FA Charity Shield . Managerial career . Clapton Orient . Seed began his managerial career at Clapton Orient . He was tempted into the job by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman who told Seed that Arsenal had plans to buy Orient and turn them into their nursery club . Seed commenced the job at £12 a week but within a short time Arsenal were forced to abandon their plans after being told by the Football League that they were unlawful . Without the financial backing of Arsenal , Orient had very little money and the team struggled . In Seeds first season as manager the team finished 16th and then in the following 1932–33 campaign they avoided having to seek re-election on goal average . In May 1933 he accepted the offer of the managers job at Charlton Athletic despite Sheffield Wednesday trying to tempt Seed back to Hillsborough as a replacement for the manager Bob Brown . Charlton Athletic . Between 1933 and 1936 he led Charlton to successive promotions from the Third Division to the First Division . In Charltons first season in the top-flight , they finished runners-up behind Manchester City in 1937 . They finished third and fourth in the final two seasons before the outbreak of the Second World War . He led the team into a variety of regional competitions set up during the war and Charlton reached a Wembley final for the first time in 1943 . They were beaten 7–1 by Arsenal in the War Cup . They were more successful in 1944 , when captain Don Welsh lifted the trophy following a 3–1 triumph over Chelsea . They contested the first two post-war FA Cup finals at Wembley , which were noted for the ball bursting on both occasions . They were well beaten 4–1 by Derby County in 1946 , but a Chris Duffy goal beat Burnley 1–0 in 1947 . Despite the revenues generated by very large home attendances , Charlton wouldnt allow Seed to invest in new players ( he discovered Stanley Matthews but wasnt allowed to sign him ) and so The Addicks were unable to repeat their pre-war success in the First Division , finishing no higher than ninth in the initial six seasons after the conflict . They narrowly missed relegation in 1949–50 with a 20th position finish , but they finished fifth in 1952–53 . Following two bottom-half-of-the-table finishes , Charlton , with key defenders missing through injury , endured a poor start to the 1956–57 season , losing their first five matches , before Jimmy Seed was sacked on 3rd September 1956 . He was asked to say he had retired through ill health , to avoid a backlash from the supporters . The South Stand at The Valley , Charltons home ground , is named after Seed . Later career . After Charlton had turned down his request to become a Director , he became an advisor at Bristol City in January 1957 , he took over as caretaker manager in January 1958 for a short while after Pat Beasley had left the club . When new Bristol boss Peter Doherty took over , Seed moved to manage Millwall in the early months of 1958 . He got off to a terrible start at The Old Den going nine matches without a win . The team eventually finished 23rd in Division Three South having to apply for re-election . The following season saw Millwall playing in the new Football League Fourth Division eventually finishing 9th . Seed stepped down as Millwall manager at the end of the 1958–59 campaign but stayed with the club as advisor and then as a club director . He continued as a director of Millwall until his death on 16 July 1966 , aged 71 .

Official League football was suspended at the end of that season because of the outbreak of World War I . At the end of the season , the 20-year-old Seed joined the Army Cyclist Corps . In the summer of 1916 , he was drafted to France with the 8th battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment . In July 1917 Seed was gassed when a German aeroplane dropped mustard gas bombs over Nieuwpoort , Belgium . Seed was with other soldiers sheltering in the basement of a bombed out building when the gas seeped in . Over fifty of his comrades died in the incident . He was sent to England to convalesce and returned to France in August 1918 , until being evacuated after being gassed in Valenciennes , France two months later . With the cessation of hostilities , Seed played a Victory League match for Sunderland against Durham City in 1918 , however his lungs were weak and he had a poor game . On the strength of that performance the Sunderland directors decided that Seeds wartime experience had finished him as a footballer and let him go , although they didnt put him on the transfer list as they thought his lungs were too damaged . Seed never played an official first team game for Sunderland . He was discharged from the army in March 1919 . Seeds football career was rescued by Haydn Price ( former Wales international ) , the manager of Welsh non-League team Mid Rhondda who were based in the town of Tonypandy . Price offered Seed a chance to play for the South Wales club which was accepted and he signed for them in July 1919 . Seed joined former England international Joe Bache and ex-teammate from Sunderland Frank Pattison in the Mid-Rhondda side and they had a successful time in the seven months that Seed was with them , winning both the Southern League Division Two and Welsh League titles . Seeds good form attracted the attention of Tottenham Hotspur manager Peter McWilliam and in January 1920 he signed for the north London side for a fee of £250 , a move which caused some antagonism amongst supporters in Tonypandy . After initially playing five games in the reserves Seed got his first team chance with Spurs , making his debut at inside right and forming an immediate understanding with the legendary , diminutive right winger Fanny Walden . Seed played five games in the remainder of the 1919–20 season , scoring two goals as Spurs ran away with the Division Two title . Seed was a virtual ever present for Spurs in the following seven seasons in Division One . The 1920–21 season saw Tottenham lift the FA Cup with Seed playing in all six matches in the cup run , scoring five goals including a hat trick against Bradford City in the second round . Just two months after getting his cup winners medal Seed was called up for the first of this five England caps on 21 May 1921 against Belgium , he never got a long run in the international side , playing his final game in April 1925 .</p><p>pred_time: Frank Pattison</p><p>groundtruth: Mid Rhondda</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-137"/wiki/Robert_Hall_(footballer)#P54#4</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Robert_Hall_(footballer)#P54#4<p>context: Robert Hall ( footballer ) Robert Kieran Dennis Hall ( born 20 October 1993 ) is an English professional footballer who plays for League One club Oxford United .

Starting in 1992 , it has been organised by Ophélie Renouard as a couture event by invitation . The young women don gowns from haute couture and couture designers , as well as foreign fashion houses . They all wear jewelry from the same jeweler . The débutantes usually come from famous families . The event raises money for charity ; the most recent editions have supported two organizations .

For example , in 2008 , French actor Jean Rocheforts daughter Clémence , made her debut wearing a Nina Ricci gown . Anna Cleveland van Ravenstein , on the other hand , had been modeling for Chanel for years before Uncle Karl [ Lagerfeld ] helped her pick out a vintage gown for le Bal . Some couture houses have produced special gowns for the event , for instance Carolina Herrera in 2003 for Diana Mellon , and , in 2014 , Danish designer Jesper Hovring for Viola Mikkelsen .

Planning and preparations include inviting the débutantes and their cavaliers and meetings with the debs and their families . From 1992 to 2012 , le Bal was organized at the Hôtel de Crillon . The Hôtel Raphael was the hotel of le Bal in 2013 and 2014 and the event was held in the Palais de Chaillot in 2015 , overlooking the Eiffel Tower . Le Bal was held at the hotel The Peninsula Paris in 2016 and 2017 , and in 2018 and 2019 at the Shangri La Hotel in Paris . Friday , or the eve of le Bal , is when the débutantes come together for the first time . The makeup and hair styling sessions start at 9:00am . Then , the débutantes don their dresses , long gloves , shoes , and jewels , and the individual and group photo sessions last for the rest of the day . On Friday evening , the débutantes fathers and cavaliers take part in a waltz class with two teachers . The débutantes have sessions with By Terry for makeup and Alexandre de Paris for hair . The débutantes are introduced in alphabetical order on the arms of their cavaliers by journalist and author Stéphane Bern . Then the dinner is served . After dinner , the débutantes who are the most followed by the media open le Bal , followed by all of the fathers with their daughters . Opening dance .

This opening dance is followed by a waltz with all of the fathers and débutantes . The fathers then cede their daughters to the cavaliers , and the waltz is replaced with contemporary music with a live band . The debs then return their dresses and their jewels . The débutantes and their cavaliers finish the evening out clubbing . The debutantes . The criteria for invitation are an attractive appearance , intelligence , and famous parents . They often come from families known in entertainment , business , or politics . As le Bal is also a couture event , the gowns are fashion show dresses and le Bals team endeavors to find the most suitable ones . From 2000 to 2003 , le Bal welcomed a winner from a contest held by the French magazine Jalouse each year . Each one was chosen based on a submitted application . Majority of the participants must familiarize themselves with wearing haute couture dresses , trading common teen fashion items for heels , tiaras and haute couture gowns worth up to £30,000 each . In interviews , the débutantes usually speak of the pleasure of wearing couture dresses , the charity aspect of the event , and the opportunity to meet girls from different countries . The cavaliers . Each débutante is escorted by a cavalier . He may be by a young man of her own choosing , such as a brother , cousin , friend , or boyfriend . However , nearly half of the débutantes , particularly those travelling from abroad dont bring their own cavaliers ; they rely instead on the organizers of le Bal to find a cavalier . As claimed by the organizer , Renouard , choosing the cavalier on their ages , the language they speak , their heights and possibly their backgrounds usually produces an optimal match for the débutantes . Media coverage . Coverage often emphasizes the cachet of the event and its elegance . It has been claimed that Le Bal has really maintained its exclusivity ; all the top designers participate , and there have never been any sleazy photographs of the débutantes .</p><p>question: Where was Bal des débutantes located from 2013 to 2014?</p><p>pred: Hôtel Raphael</p><p>context_time: Some couture houses have produced special gowns for the event , for instance Carolina Herrera in 2003 for Diana Mellon , and , in 2014 , Danish designer Jesper Hovring for Viola Mikkelsen .

She was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and also of Emperor Alexander II of Russia . Born a British princess , Victoria spent her early life in England and lived for three years in Malta , where her father served in the Royal Navy . In 1889 the family moved to Coburg , where Victorias father became the reigning duke in 1893 . In her teens Victoria fell in love with her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia ( the son of her mothers brother , Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia ) but his faith , Orthodox Christianity , discouraged marriage between first cousins . Bowing to family pressure , Victoria married her paternal first-cousin , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1894 , following the wishes of their grandmother , Queen Victoria . The marriage failed – Victoria Melita scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901 . The couples only child , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , died of typhoid fever in 1903 . Victoria married Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich in 1905 . They wed without the formal approval of Britains King Edward VII ( as the Royal Marriages Act 1772 would have required ) , and in defiance of Russias Emperor Nicholas II . In retaliation , the Tsar stripped Kirill of his offices and honours , also initially banishing the couple from Russia . They had two daughters and settled in Paris before being allowed to visit Russia in 1909 . In 1910 they moved to Russia , where Nicholas recognized Victoria Melita as Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna . After the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917 they escaped to Finland ( then still part of the Russian Republic ) where she gave birth to her only son in August 1917 . In exile they lived for some years among her relatives in Germany , and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac in Brittany . In 1926 Kirill proclaimed himself Russian emperor in exile , and Victoria supported her husbands claims . Victoria died after suffering a stroke while visiting her daughter Maria in Amorbach ( Lower Franconia ) . Early life . Victoria was born on 25 November 1876 in San Anton Palace in Attard , Malta , hence her second name , Melita . Her father , who was stationed on the island as an officer in the Royal Navy , was Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , the second son of Queen Victoria . Her mother was Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna , the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse . As a grandchild of the British monarch , she was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Edinburgh . Within her family , she was always known as Ducky . At the time of her birth , she was 10th in the line of succession to the British throne . The princess was christened on 1 January 1877 at San Anton Palace by a Royal Navy chaplain . Her godparents included her paternal grandmother Queen Victoria , who was represented by a proxy . After the Duke’s service in Malta was over , they returned to England , where the family lived for the next few years . They divided their time between Eastwell Park , their country home in Kent , and Clarence House , their residence in London facing Buckingham Palace . Eastwell , a large estate of 2,500 acres near Ashford , with its forest and park was the childrens favorite residence . In January 1886 , shortly after Princess Victoria turned nine , the family left England when her father was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean naval squadron , based on Malta . For the next three years , the family lived at the San Anton Palace in Malta , Victorias birthplace . The marriage of her parents was unhappy . The Duke was taciturn , unfaithful , prone to drinking and emotionally detached from his family . Victorias mother was independent-minded and cultured . Although she was unsentimental and strict , the Duchess was a devoted mother and the most important person in her childrens lives . As a child , Victoria had a difficult temperament . She was shy , serious and sensitive . In the judgment of her sister Marie : This passionate child was often misunderstood . Princess Victoria Melita was talented at drawing and painting and learned to play the piano . She was particularly close to Marie . The two sisters would remain very close throughout their lives . They contrasted in appearance and personality . Victoria was dark and moody while Marie was blonde and easy-going . Although she was one year younger , Victoria was taller and seemed to be the older of the two . Youth in Coburg . As a son of Queen Victorias deceased husband , Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , Victoria Melitas father was in the line of succession to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha , the sovereign German duchy ruled by Alberts elder brother , Ernest II , until his death in 1893 . Prince Alfred became heir presumptive to the duchy when his older brother , the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII ) , relinquished his Saxon succession rights in favour of his younger brothers . Alfred and his family therefore moved to Coburg in 1889 . Their mother immediately began attempting to Germanise her daughters by installing a new governess , buying them plain clothing , and having them confirmed in the German Lutheran church , even though they had previously been raised as Anglicans . The children rebelled and some of the new restrictions were eased . The teenage Victoria was a tall , dark girl , with violet eyes .. . with the assuredness of an Empress and the high spirits of a tomboy , according to one observer . Victoria had too little chin to be conventionally beautiful , in the opinion of one of her biographers , but she had a good figure , deep blue eyes , and dark complexion . In 1891 , Victoria travelled with her mother to the funeral of her maternal aunt Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia . There Victoria met her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich . Although the two were deeply attracted to each other , Victorias mother was reluctant to allow her to marry him because the Russian Orthodox faith forbids the marriage of first cousins . She was also suspicious of the morality of the Romanov men . When her teenage daughters were impressed by their handsome cousins , their mother warned them that the Russian grand dukes did not make good husbands . Soon after her sister Marie was married to Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania , a search was made for a suitable husband for Victoria . Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle in the autumn of 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse , heir apparent to the grand ducal throne of Hesse . Both were artistic and fun loving , got along well and even shared a birthday . The Queen , observing this , was very keen for her two grandchildren to marry . Grand Duchess of Hesse . Eventually , Victoria and Ernst bowed to their families pressure and married on 19 April 1894 at Schloss Ehrenburg in Coburg . The wedding was a large affair , with most of the royal families of Europe attending , including Queen Victoria , the Empress Frederick , Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Prince of Wales . Victoria became Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine , Ernest having ascended the throne in 1892 . Her wedding is also significant since at the same time the official engagement of the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Ernsts younger sister , Alix , was proclaimed . Together Victoria and Ernst had two children , a daughter , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , who they nicknamed Ella , born on 11 March 1895 , and a stillborn son , born on 25 May 1900 . Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible . Victoria despaired of her husbands lack of affection towards her , while Ernst devoted much of his attention to their daughter , who he adored . Elisabeth , who physically resembled her mother , preferred the company of her father to Victoria . Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends . Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty was old and out . Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished . Victoria and Ernst cultivated friends who were progressive artists and intellectuals as well as those who enjoyed fun and frolic . Victorias cousin Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark remembered one stay there as the jolliest , merriest house party to which I have ever been in my life . Victoria was , however , less enthusiastic about fulfilling her public role . She avoided answering letters , put off visits to elderly relations whose company she did not enjoy , and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring . Victorias inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst . The young couple had loud , physical fights . The volatile Victoria shouted , threw tea trays , smashed china against the wall , and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments . Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan . While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II , Victorias affection for Kirill was also rekindled . She enjoyed flirting with him at the balls and celebrations that marked the coronation . Divorce . Her marriage to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897 , when Victoria returned home from a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst in bed with a male servant . She did not make her accusation public , but told a niece that no boy was safe , from the stable hands to the kitchen help . He slept quite openly with them all . Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan , her chargé daffaires , but refused to consent to her grandchildrens divorce because of their daughter , Elisabeth . Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and , when Queen Victoria died in January 1901 , significant opposition to the end of the marriage was removed . The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901 . Ernst , who had at first resisted the divorce , came to believe it was the only possible step . Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad , Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg . For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless . I only tried for her sake . If I had not loved her so , I would have given it up long ago . Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was . Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage , it had been a failure .. . [ T ] heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart . The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe . Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than the general disgrace of a divorce . Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge . The doctor advised the Tsars family to notify the childs mother of her illness , but it is rumored that the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram . Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the childs death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside . At Elisabeths funeral , Victoria removed her Hessian Order , a medallion , and placed it on her daughters coffin as a final gesture that she had made a final break with her old home . Remarriage . After Victorias divorce from Ernst , Grand Duke Kirill , whom Victoria had seen on all her subsequent visits to Russia , was discouraged by his parents from trying to keep a close relationship with her . Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else . A few months later , war broke out between Russia and Japan . As a senior member of the navy , Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo-Japanese War . His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors . Sent home to recover , the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria . The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirills determination to marry Victoria . To those over whom the shadow of death has passed , life has a new meaning , Kirill wrote in his memoirs . It is like daylight . And I was now within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life . Nothing would cheat me of it now . I had gone through much . Now , at last , the future lay radiant before me . The couple married on 8 October 1905 in Tegernsee . It was a simple ceremony , with Victorias mother , her sister Beatrice , and a friend , Count Adlerburg , in attendance , along with servants . The couples uncle Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia was invited , without being told the reason , but did not arrive until after the ceremony . Tsar Nicholas II responded to the marriage by stripping Kirill of his imperial allowance and expelling him from the Russian navy . The Tsarina was outraged at her former sister-in-law and said she would never receive Victoria , a woman who had behaved so disgracefully , or Kirill . The couple retired to Paris , where they purchased a house off the Champs-Élysées and lived off the income provided by their parents . Victoria , who had matured as she entered her 30s , decided to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1907 , a decision that thrilled both her mother and her husband . Three days later the first of their three children , Maria Kirillovna , was born . She was named after both her grandmothers and nicknamed Masha . Their second daughter , Kira Kirillovna , was born in Paris in 1909 . Victoria and Kirill , who had hoped for a son , were disappointed to have a girl , but named their daughter after her father . Grand Duchess of Russia . Nicholas II reinstated Kirill after deaths in the Russian imperial family promoted Kirill to third in the line of succession to the Russian throne . Kirill and Victoria were allowed in Russia , Victoria was granted the title of Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna and in May 1910 , the couple arrived in St Petersburg . The new grand duchess enjoyed entertaining at evening dinners and lavish balls attended by the cream of Saint Petersburg society . Victoria had an artistic talent that she applied to home decoration in her several elaborate residences , which she arranged attractively . She decorated , gardened , and rode and also enjoyed painting , particularly watercolors . Victoria fit in within the Russian aristocracy and the circle of her mother-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna . As French was frequently spoken in high circles , Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language . Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II , on her mothers side , and to Empress Alexandra , on her fathers side , the relationship with them was neither close nor warm . As Kirill became a keen auto racer , the couple often took trips by car ; a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces . Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days , and she traveled abroad , frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother in the south of France or in Coburg . Victoria and her husband had a close relationship with their daughters , Maria and Kira . The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out . War . During World War I , Victoria worked as a Red Cross nurse and organized a motorized ambulance unit that was known for its efficiency . Victoria frequently visited the front near Warsaw and she occasionally carried out her duties under enemy fire . Kirill , for his part , was also in Poland , assigned to the naval department of Admiral Russin , member of the staff of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich , commander in chief of the Russian army . Kirill and Victoria had always shared their relatives distaste for the Tsar and Tsarinas friendship with the starets Grigori Rasputin . The Tsarina believed Rasputin healed her son of his hemophiliac attacks with his prayers . Victoria told her sister , Queen Marie of Romania , that the Tsars court was looked upon as a sick man refusing every doctor and every help . When Rasputin was murdered in December 1916 , Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other relatives asking the Tsar to show leniency to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , one of those implicated in the murder . The Tsar denied their request . Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania , where her sister Marie was now queen , volunteering aid for war victims . Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917 . Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards , quartered in Saint Petersburg , so he could be with his family for some time . Although publicly loyal to the Tsar , Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other relatives to discuss the best way to save the monarchy . Revolution . At the end of the February Revolution of 1917 , Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and political turmoil followed . Victoria wrote to Queen Marie of Romania in February 1917 that their home was surrounded by a mob , yet heart and soul we are with this movement of freedom which at the time probably signs our own death warrant .. . We personally are losing all , our lives changed at one blow and yet we are almost leading the movement . By March 1917 , the revolution had spread all over Petrograd ( Saint Petersburg ) . During this period Victoria , almost 41 years old , discovered she was again pregnant , which worried her because of her previous miscarriages and difficult pregnancies . Kirill led his naval unit to the Provisional Government on 14 March 1917 , which was obliged to share headquarters with the new Petrograd Soviet , and swore loyalty to its leadership , hoping to restore order and preserve the monarchy . It was an action which later provoked criticism from some members of the family , who viewed it as treason . Victoria supported her husband and felt he was doing the right thing . She also sympathized with the people who wanted to reform the government . Kirill was forced to resign his command of the Naval Guards , but nevertheless his men remained faithful and they continued to guard Kirill and Victorias palace on Glinka Street . Close to despair , Victoria wrote to her sister Marie of Romania that they had neither pride nor hope , nor money , nor future , and the dear past blotted out by the frightful present ; nothing is left , nothing . Anxious for their safety , Kirill and Victoria decided that the best thing to do was to leave Russia . They chose Finland as the best possible place to go . Although a territory of the Russian Empire , Finland possessed its own government and constitution , so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time . They had already been once invited to Haikko , a beautiful estate , near Porvoo , a small town on the south coast of Finland , not far away from Helsinki . The Provisional Government permitted them to leave , though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them . They sewed jewels into the familys clothing , hoping they would not be discovered by the authorities . They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917 . Exile . After two weeks in Haikko , the family moved to a rented house in Porvoo where , in August 1917 , Victoria gave birth to Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia , her only son and the heir to the dynasty . The family remained in Finland , a former grand duchy under Russian rule , which had declared its independence in December 1917 . They hoped that the White Russians would prevail . They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family . In July 1918 , Victoria wrote to her first cousin , Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden , begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir . She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs . She pleaded with her cousin , George V , to help the White Russians retake the country . In a letter to the King , Lord Acton , the British minister in Helsinki , noted the toll the revolution had taken on Victoria . She looked aged and battered and has lost much of her beauty , which is not astonishing considering all that she has gone through . After more than two years living under strained conditions , in the autumn of 1919 Victoria and Kirill left Finland and went to Germany . In Munich they were reunited with Victorias mother and the family group moved to Zurich in September 1919 . With the death of Victorias mother , she inherited her villa , Chateau Fabron in Nice and her residence in Coburg , the Edinburg Palais . In the following years the exiled family divided their time between these two places . While in Germany , Victoria showed an interest in the Nazi Party , which appealed to her because of its anti-Bolshevik stance and her hope that the movement might help restore the Russian monarchy . She attended a Nazi rally in Coburg in 1922 . She was likely unaware of the most sinister aspects of the Nazi Party . Claims to the Russian throne . Kirill suffered a nervous breakdown in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health . She encouraged his dreams of restoring the monarchy in Russia and becoming tsar . At Saint-Briac Kirill , aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and his only son , officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924 . Victoria went on a trip to the United States in 1924 , hoping to raise American support for restoration of the monarchy . Her efforts evoked little response , due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s . She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork to raise money for the household . By the mid-1920s , Victoria worried over the prospects of her children . Maria , her eldest daughter , married the head of one of Germanys mediatized families , Karl , Hereditary Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925 , Victoria’s 49th birthday . Victoria was at her daughters bedside when she gave birth to her first child , Emich Kirill , in 1926 ( later father of claimant to the Russian throne , Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen ) . She also attended the subsequent births of Marias children . In the mid-1920s , the German government established relations with Moscow and the presence of Kirill and his wife , pretenders to the Russian throne , became an embarrassment . Although the Bavarian government rejected pressures to expel the Russian claimant , Kirill and Victoria decided to establish their permanent residence in France . In the summer of 1926 they moved to Saint-Briac on the Breton coast , where they had spent their summer vacations . The remoteness of Brittany provided both privacy and security . They bought a large house on the outskirts of the town and gave it a Breton name , Ker Argonid , Villa Victoria . The resort town of Saint-Briac was a favorite spot for retired British citizens who wanted to live well on a limited income . Victoria made friends among the Britons as well as the French and other foreign residents of the town . Though at first her manner could seem haughty , residents soon discovered that Victoria was more approachable than her husband . Their friends treated them with deference , curtsying or calling them by their imperial titles . They lived a secluded country life , finding it more agreeable than at Coburg . Victoria was exceedingly protective of her son Vladimir , upon whom her hopes for the future rested . She would not let him attend school because she was worried about his safety and because she wanted him to be brought up as Romanov grand dukes were prior to the revolution . Instead , she hired a tutor for him . She also refused to let him be educated for a future career . In return for her devotion , Vladimir loved and respected his mother . We adored our parents and their love for us was infinite , Vladimir wrote after their deaths . All the hardships and bitterness we had to endure in the years were fully covered by our mutual love . We were proud of ( them ) . Last years . In Saint-Briac , during the summer , Kirill played golf and he and Victoria joined in picnics and excursions . They were part of the social life of the community , going out to play bridge and organizing theatricals . During the winter Victoria and her husband enjoyed visiting nearby Dinard and invited friends home for parties and games . However , it was rumored in town that Kirill went to Paris for the occasional fling . Victoria , who had devoted her life to Kirill , was devastated when she discovered in 1933 that her husband had been unfaithful to her , according to correspondence of her sister Marie of Romania . She kept up a façade for the sake of her children , including her teenage son Vladimir , but was unable to forgive Kirills betrayal . Victoria suffered a stroke soon after attending the christening of her fifth grandchild , Mechtilde of Leiningen , in February 1936 . Family and friends arrived , but nothing could be done . When her closest sister reached her bedside Victoria was asked if she was glad Marie had come , to which Victoria haltingly replied , It makes all the difference . However , she shuddered away from Kirills touch , wrote Marie . She died on 1 March 1936 . Queen Marie eulogized her sister in a letter after her death : The whole thing was tragic beyond imagination , a tragic end to a tragic life . She carried tragedy within her – she had tragic eyes – always – even as a little girl – but we loved her enormously , there was something mighty about her – she was our Conscience . Victoria was buried in the ducal family mausoleum at in Coburg , until her remains were transferred to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1995 . Her husband was intensely lonely after her death . The marriage of their daughter , Kira , to Louis Ferdinand , Prince of Prussia , in 1938 was a bright spot for Kirill , who saw it as the joining of two dynasties . However , Kirill died just two years after his wife . Kirill , though he had been unfaithful , still loved and missed the wife he had depended so much upon and passed his remaining years writing memoirs of their life together . There are few who in one person combine all that is best in soul , mind , and body , he wrote . She had it all , and more . Few there are who are fortunate in having such a woman as the partner of their lives – I was one of those privileged . Honours and arms .

In 1889 the family moved to Coburg , where Victorias father became the reigning duke in 1893 . In her teens Victoria fell in love with her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia ( the son of her mothers brother , Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia ) but his faith , Orthodox Christianity , discouraged marriage between first cousins . Bowing to family pressure , Victoria married her paternal first-cousin , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine in 1894 , following the wishes of their grandmother , Queen Victoria . The marriage failed – Victoria Melita scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901 . The couples only child , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , died of typhoid fever in 1903 . Eventually , Victoria and Ernst bowed to their families pressure and married on 19 April 1894 at Schloss Ehrenburg in Coburg . The wedding was a large affair , with most of the royal families of Europe attending , including Queen Victoria , the Empress Frederick , Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Prince of Wales . Victoria became Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine , Ernest having ascended the throne in 1892 . Her wedding is also significant since at the same time the official engagement of the future Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Ernsts younger sister , Alix , was proclaimed . Together Victoria and Ernst had two children , a daughter , Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine , who they nicknamed Ella , born on 11 March 1895 , and a stillborn son , born on 25 May 1900 . Victoria , who had matured as she entered her 30s , decided to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1907 , a decision that thrilled both her mother and her husband . Three days later the first of their three children , Maria Kirillovna , was born . She was named after both her grandmothers and nicknamed Masha . Their second daughter , Kira Kirillovna , was born in Paris in 1909 . Victoria and Kirill , who had hoped for a son , were disappointed to have a girl , but named their daughter after her father . - Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St .

Club career . Derby County . Though born in London , Addison moved to Nottingham at the age of three , where he was spotted by scouts from the Derby County youth system when he was playing for Clifton All Whites FC . Addison was handed his first team debut by interim manager Terry Westley , who he had worked closely with in the youth and reserve teams , towards the end of the 2005–06 season , in the 1–1 Championship draw with Hull City on 17 April 2006 , where he played in the centreback position alongside side another academy graduate Lewin Nyatanga . He kept his place for the following match , a 2–0 defeat away to Ipswich five days later . With the appointment of Billy Davies as Derby manager , Addison found himself frozen out of the first team at Derby and didnt appear in the starting eleven again until Davies successor , Paul Jewell , gave him a surprise start , again at centreback , in a 3–1 defeat away to Blackburn Rovers in the penultimate game of the 2007–08 Premier League season . Derbys poor start to the 2008–09 season saw Addison given a chance to cement a place in the first team and he was given his first start of the campaign in the 1–0 League Cup win at Preston North End on 26 August 2008 . Starting in his preferred position of central midfield for the first time , Addison impressed enough to retain his place for the subsequent match away to Barnsley . This was the start of a run of 15 consecutive appearances in the first team , which was only ended when suspension for reaching five yellow cards ruled him out of the League Cup 4th round tie against Leeds United . Addison formed a formidable midfield partnership with Paul Green during this time as the Rams embarked on a run of only two defeats in 13 matches and moved from the bottom of the table to the fringes of the playoff places . Addisons form earned high praise from Jewell as an example to the clubs other academy players and saw him sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the club on 2 September to keep him at the club until 2011 . November saw Addison linked with a £2 million move to Premier League Stoke . However , Jewell denied this , saying I spoke to Tony ( Pulis , Stoke manager ) about another matter and he never mentioned it . We are not going to sell Miles Addison . He wont be getting sold . Everybody has their price I guess , but we have worked too hard over the past year and gone through too many tortures to now start selling our best players . Addison was denied his first goal for the club in the controversial East Midlands derby on 2 November 2008 when Stuart Attwell incorrectly ruled two late Addison headers which would have given Derby a 2–1 win , with the match instead finishing 1–1 . but eventually got his first professional goal with the second in a 3–0 home win over Sheffield Wednesday on 15 November 2008 . On 20 December 2008 , he captained the side for the whole game against Watford , as the result ended in a 1–0 win . Addison said it was a dream to captain the side who I support . Addison was substituted during Derbys 4–1 win over Blackpool , an injury which was later diagnosed to be a stress fracture of his foot , which ruled him out for the rest of the 2008–09 season . Despite missing the latter part of the campaign Addisons form was such that he won the Sammy Crooks Trophy – Derby Countys Young Player of the Season award – for the 2008–09 season . Addison had a great start to the 2009–10 season with goals against Peterborough United and Plymouth Argyle , but a succession of foot problems restricted him to just five starts between October 2009 and February 2010 and he underwent specialist surgery in America . The surgery was successful but he was ruled out for the remainder of Derbys 2009–10 season as well as the entirety of the 2010–11 campaign . However , Addison made a quicker than expected recovery , with Clough suggesting he may be back in first team action as early as January 2011 . He was pencilled in to play a reserve game against Sheffield Wednesday on 26 October 2010 , but was later withdrawn as a precaution after admitting he felt a bit stiff . He eventually took to the pitch in a competitive capacity when he came on as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2–0 home win over Portsmouth on 6 November 2010 , his first appearance in 10 months , as Derby reached 4th in the table . However , he suffered another injury after an operation on his foot and was sidelined for six weeks . Then , on 1 January 2011 , he returned to the first team , where he came on as a late substitute , in a 2–1 win over Preston North End . He then scored his first goal of the season on 10 January 2011 , in a 2–1 loss against Crawley Town in the third round of the FA Cup . On 21 June 2011 , Addison signed a contract extension , extending his stay at Pride Park until summer 2013 . Loan at Barnsley . On 24 June 2011 , Addison joined fellow Championship club , Barnsley on six-month loan deal . He made his Barnsley debut , where he started the whole game , in a 0–0 draw against Nottingham Forest in the opening game of the season . However , he found himself behind the pecking order in the first team throughout his time at the club . Despite this , Addisons loan was extended until 28 January 2012 . Addison returned to Derby in January 2012 after making 13 appearances for Barnsley , 11 of which were starts . Loan at Bournemouth . After his loan spell finish at Barnsley , Addison found first-team appearances hard to come by at Pride Park due to the form of central defenders Shaun Barker and Jason Shackell . On 21 February 2012 , Addison joined Football League One side Bournemouth on loan until the end of the season . Following his loan move to Bournemouth , Addison hinted that he would be open to a permanent move and said his calling his treatment by Derby as strange . On 25 February 2012 , Addison made his first start , where he played 90 minutes for Bournemouth in a 1–0 loss against MK Dons . On 10 March 2012 , Addison scored an own goal to put Sheffield Wednesday , in a 3–0 loss against Sheffield Wednesday . In a follow up match against Carlisle United on 17 March 2012 , Addison scored his first goal for Bournemouth in the 83rd minute in a 1–1 draw to end a run of five defeats for Bournemouth . On 13 April 2012 , Addison expressed an interest to make his move to Bournemouth permanent . Addison featured 14 times for Bournemouth , who ended the season 11th as their play-off hopes faded in April . Upon his return to Derby , Bournemouth stated their interest in making the transfer permanent in the summer and on 22 May 2012 , Addison was transfer listed by the club with a year left on his contract . As well as Bournemouth there was reported interest from several Championship clubs according to Nigel Clough . It came after when Derby manager Nigel Clough said on 16 April 2012 , that Addison was free to leave the club , stating the form of Craig Bryson , Jeff Hendrick , Mark OBrien , Jake Buxton and Jason Shackell as the reason , with Bournemouth stating an interest in a permanent deal . Bournemouth . On 12 July 2012 , Addison joined Bournemouth for an undisclosed fee . At the start of the 2012–13 season , Addison captained the side in number of matches following the departure of Adam Barrett . His captaincy lasted halfway through between the start of the season and November . He also formed a central–defence partnership with Tommy Elphick . Addison continued to captain the side until he suffered a foot injury in the beginning of December . Initially out for three–four weeks , he was eventually sidelined for the rest of the 2012–13 season . Despite this , Addison was involved in the squad that saw Bournemoiuth promoted to the Championship for next season , as he made twenty–two appearances in all competitions . However , over the next two seasons at Bournemouth , Addison found his first team opportunities at the club hard to come by and appeared on the substitute bench . At the end of the 2014–15 season , Addison was released by the club upon expiry of his contract . Loan Spells from Bournemouth . Having been told by Manager Eddie Howe that he was expecting to be loaned out to fight for his first team place , Addison joined Rotherham United on loan until the end of the season on 6 January 2014 . He made his Rotherham United debut , where he started the whole game , in a 4–2 win over Crewe Alexandra on 11 January 2014 . Although he was featured in the starting lineup in number of matches , Addison was soon sidelined out of the first team , due to fallen out of favour and his own injury concern . After the club was promoted to the Championship for next season , Addison went on to make six appearances in all competitions . On 28 July 2014 , Addison joined Scunthorpe United on a one-month loan deal . He made his Scunthorpe United debut , where he came on as a substitute , in a 1–0 loss against Blackburn Rovers in the first round of the League Cup . Seven days later , on 19 August 2014 , Addison started the whole game in the centre–back position , in a 2–0 loss against Fleetwood Town . However , he suffered an injury during a 2–1 win over Walsall on 30 August 2014 and his loan spell with the club was terminated shortly after , as he went on to make five appearances for the side . After being told by Bournemouth that he was going to be loaned out once again , Addison joined Blackpool on loan for one month . On the same day , Addison made his Blackpool debut , where he started the whole game , in a 1–0 loss against Birmingham City . On 1 April 2015 , Addison had his loan spell at Blackpool extended until the end of the season . He later played three times in defensive midfield position and two times in centre–back position . Despite missing out six matches during his loan spell at Blackpool , as they were relegated to League Two , Addison went on to make six appearances for Blackpool and returned to his parent club at the end of the season . Peterborough United . On 24 November 2015 , Addison signed for Peterborough United on a short-term contract . Later on the same day , Addison scored on his debut against former club Barnsley in a 3–2 win . A month later , he signed a one–month contract extension with the club . He went on to make two appearances ( three in total ) before being released by the club in late–January . Kilmarnock . On 30 March 2016 , Addison signed for Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock , agreeing a contract until the end of the season . Addison made his Kilmarnock debut , where he started the whole game , in a 0–0 draw against Partick Thistle on 2 April 2016 , keeping a clean sheet . He also kept another clean sheet in a follow up match against St . Johnstone , which they won 3–0 . Since joining the club , he quickly established himself in the starting eleven to help the club fight to avoid relegation . He scored his first goal for the club on 22 May 2016 as Killie beat Falkirk 4–0 in the second leg of the Premiership play-off final at Rugby Park . At the end of the 2015–16 season , Addison went on to make eight appearances for the side . Ahead of the 2016–17 season , Addison was keen on staying at the club , which he eventually signed a three–year contract , keeping him until 2019 . In the 2016–17 season , Addison continued to be a first team regular for the side and was given the vice–captaincy role . He then suffered ankle injury during a 2–0 loss against Ross County on 26 August 2016 that saw him sidelined for a month . It wasnt until on 5 October 2016 when he returned to the first team from injury , coming on as a late substitute , in a 4–0 defeat to Aberdeen . Then , on 22 October 2016 , Addison captained the side for the first time in four years , in a 1–1 draw against Inverness CT . However , he suffered a foot injury that he sustained in late–November and was sidelined until late–January after surgery . He returned in mid–February and made two more appearances , including against Aberdeen on 19 February 2017 , where he was at fault for conceding two goals , in a 2–1 defeat . Following this , Addison never played for the club again for the rest of the season and was released in the latter part of the 2016–17 season . Nuneaton Borough . In June 2018 , Addison joined Nuneaton Borough of the National League North . Addison made his Nuneaton Borough debut , where he started the whole game , in a 0–0 draw against Ashton United , keeping a clean sheet in the process . In the next two matches , he helped the side keep two more clean sheets and conceded one goal . He captained the side for the first time on 27 August 2018 , where the side lose 3–1 against Brackley Town . Stratford . In October 2020 , Addison joined Southern Football League side Stratford Town . International career . Addison was called up to the England under-21 for the teams UEFA U21 European Championship Qualification games against FYR Macedonia and Greece on 27 August 2009 . Addison came on as a substitute against Greece to earn his first international cap . Personal life . In May 2013 , Addison was fined for £1,185 for driving under an influence and was banned from driving for 18 months . Honours .

It is now called the International Cemetery , Cremation &amp; Funeral Association ( ICCF ) . Background . The first movement to create an association for cemetery superintendents was started in 1886 by eighteen individuals,&lt;ref and the organization first met in October 1887 in Cincinnati , Ohio under the leadership of Charles Nichols . The foremost purpose of the AACS was educational , and the published works from each annual meeting became much sought-after by librarians and other institutions of learning . These published works were written by cemetery superintendents , illustrating points of importance they would like share with their fellow cemetery superintendents . The Association was devoted to the betterment of cemeteries and their maintenance . The Association was successful in improving the state of cemeteries across the United States , and in encouraging cemetery superintendents to keep their graveyards well-maintained . One example of the Association’s effect on society would be its improvement of cemeteries in rural America . One of the AACS’s concerns was that of the upkeep of rural cemeteries , and how to improve and gather interest in them . In an instance mentioned in the 20th Annual Convention Proceedings , a member of the AACS described how he motivated a group of cemetery superintendents . This group of cemetery superintendents was composed entirely of women , and they were in charge of an extremely old country churchs cemetery.&lt;ref With the encouragement to improve their graveyard , the committee was motivated and driven to better their cemetery’s appearance and upkeep , resulting in a much more pleasant cemetery . This instance illustrates how the AACS was able to affect whole communities of cemetery superintendents , for this is but one example of the many concerns the AACS had for American cemeteries . One of the three oldest societies devoted to conserving landscape and cemetery gardening,&lt;ref and rural art in the United States , the Association of American Cemetery Superintendents still exists today . Association beginnings . The Association created guidelines for plotting the grounds , headstone size , and material for vaults/monuments . In 1888 , Jacob Weidenmann who was a cemetery engineer , published an essay called Modern Cemeteries : An Essay on the Improvement and Proper Management of Rural Cemeteries . This essay diagrammed different land plotting techniques , and how to landscape different areas to improve the look of unused plots . In 1890 , the AACS created guidelines for headstone size , standardized the height of grave mounds to 4 inches , and limited the amount of monuments on family plots to 1 . The AACS also limited the number of vaults in a cemetery and gave recommendations to the best material to build monuments and vaults out of . These were some of the Associations most monumental improvements to cemeteries because it created guidelines to standardized the look of cemeteries while still having each cemetery be unique to what the superintendent envisioned . Association development . In the first 20 years of the association , they made great changes to all the cemeteries in their charge . They renovated and cared for the cemeteries by working on the grasses , gravestones , and other aspects of the cemeteries . One group of cemeteries that was unavailable to be helped by the association was the church yards . The church yards dont have superintendents or anyone in charge of them , which is why it was hard for the association to help them . At the Chicago convention , John Thorp had an idea to try and fix the church yards . He wanted to use the local newspaper as a way to spark concern in the community . This didnt work because the local newspapers didnt think cemeteries were worthy news . Another way that the association worked to help church yards was for the church to appoint a committee of all women and use the motto Keep Clean . This was to make it hard for people to object to the upkeep of the church yards since it would not be considered an issue for men . The Association wanted to just get people interested in the well being of cemeteries so that the public would have a reason to keep up the cemeteries . International Cemetery , Cremation &amp; Funeral Association . During the first century of operation the Association of American Cemetery superintendents underwent multiple name changes until landing on the International Cemetery , and Funeral Association in 1996 . The word cremation was added in 2007 to represent a fuller vision of the goal of the association . The association is made of 9,100 cemeteries , crematoriums , memorials , and other services across the world . It holds conventions and meetings to update people on the laws and regulations along with educational meetings .

He has played in the Premier League and Football League for Birmingham City , Sunderland , West Bromwich Albion , Preston North End , Millwall , Cheltenham Town and Northampton Town . A former England under-19 and under-20 international , Carter began his career with Birmingham City , and came to prominence at the age of 18 when his penalty in the 2002 First Division play-off final clinched the clubs promotion to the Premier League . He was loaned to Sunderland in winter 2004 , before he was sold to West Bromwich Albion for £1.5 million in July 2005 . In August 2007 , he joined Preston North End for a fee of up to £1.25 million . Loaned to Millwall in the 2010–11 season , he later had to spend the 2011–12 season without a club after tearing a groin muscle during a trial match . He returned to action in the 2012–13 campaign with Cheltenham Town , and then spent two seasons with Northampton Town . He spent the next two seasons with Forest Green Rovers of the National League before joining Solihull Moors in 2017 . Club career . Birmingham City . Carter was born in Solihull , West Midlands . He made his first-team debut for Birmingham City in the First Division at the age of 18 in a 1–0 defeat to local rivals West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on 29 January 2002 . He scored his first goal in senior football on 10 April , helping the Blues to secure a play-off spot with a 3–1 victory over Crewe Alexandra at St Andrews . On 12 May , he made himself a Birmingham City hero when he scored the decisive penalty in the shoot-out to win the play-off final against Norwich City at the Millennium Stadium . The match had finished 1–1 after extra time and the spot-kick sealed Birminghams promotion to the Premier League . Carter played only 12 Premier League matches in the 2002–03 season , with half of these appearances coming before mid-October . His first team opportunities were even more restricted in the 2003–04 campaign , as he featured in just five Premier League matches . Despite this , he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract in January 2004 after 20 months of negotiations . In March 2004 he was scheduled to go out on loan to Rotherham United before injuries and suspensions at Birmingham persuaded manager Steve Bruce to put an end to the deal . He was loaned to Sunderland in September 2004 . Carter scored on his debut , in a 3–1 victory over Preston North End at the Stadium of Light on 18 September . He made nine further appearances for the club before being recalled by Birmingham on 6 December . This gave his Birmingham career the boost it needed , and he was seen as a vital member of the squad until his July 2005 transfer to West Bromwich Albion for £1.5 million . At the end of the 2004–05 season , Sunderland won promotion to the Premier League as champions of the Championship . West Bromwich Albion . Carter made his West Bromwich Albion debut at The Hawthorns in a 3–2 defeat to his former club Birmingham on 27 August 2005 . He initially struggled to make the bench , and on 11 October manager Bryan Robson said that he is still very much in my thoughts at this time . He scored his first goal for the club four days later with a volley in a 2–1 victory over Arsenal ; the strike won him the clubs Goal-of-the-Season Award . The Baggies were relegated at the end of the 2005–06 season , and Carter was singled out for booing by the home crowd . He made 33 appearances in the Championship in the 2006–07 season , and was used as a substitute in the play-off final defeat to Derby County at Wembley Stadium , replacing Zoltán Gera on 71 minutes . Preston North End . After manager Tony Mowbray confirmed that Carter could not be guaranteed first-team football at West Bromwich Albion , he signed a four-year deal with Preston North End , managed by Paul Simpson . The move was completed on 9 August 2007 , for an initial £750,000 fee with potential to rise to £1.25m , and the contract included a 20% sell-on clause . Carter made his Preston debut in a 0–0 draw with Norwich City at Deepdale two days later , and his performance earned him a place in the Championship Team of the Week . In February 2008 , Carter scored a 93rd-minute own goal for Portsmouth to knock Preston out of the FA Cup at the fifth round stage . He finished the 2007–08 campaign with 43 appearances . Manager Alan Irvine started Carter in just eight matches in the following season , and the midfielder later admitted the season was nothing short of a disaster for me personally . Preston reached the play-off semi-finals , but lost 2–1 on aggregate to Sheffield United . Carter was transfer-listed at the end of the 2009–10 season after complaining of a lack of first-team opportunities under new manager Darren Ferguson . In July 2010 he spent a week on trial with Millwall , but a proposed six-month loan move fell through . He then joined Southampton on trial . On 4 August , he joined Kenny Jacketts Millwall on a three-month loan . He made his debut on the opening day of the new season , and was sent off for two bookable offences as his new club won 3–0 away at Bristol City . The loan deal was extended to January . He made five starts and six substitute appearances for the Lions . On his return from loan , Carter went straight into Prestons starting eleven under new manager Phil Brown . He opened the scoring in the FA Cup-tie against Nottingham Forest , his first match for Preston for nine months ; Forest won 2–1 . After Preston were relegated to League One and Carters contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season , he trained with the club during July , but no terms were agreed on a new deal . Carter began training with former club Birmingham City in August in the hope of earning a contract , but after no deal was forthcoming he had a trial in October with fellow Championship club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion , but manager Gus Poyet told him he was looking for a more physical type of midfielder . While playing for Nottingham Forest reserves in November as part of another trial , Carter tore a groin muscle , requiring surgery and a three-month recovery period . Once he regained fitness towards the end of the 2011–12 season , he played for Walsalls reserves , and returned to Birmingham City for pre-season training . Cheltenham Town . In August 2012 , Carter signed a six-month contract with League Two club Cheltenham Town . He re-signed with the Robins in January , to keep him at Whaddon Road until the end of the 2012–13 season . Cheltenham reached the play-off semi-finals , where they were beaten by Northampton Town ; Carter was an unused substitute in both legs . In May 2013 , he was released by Cheltenham after manager Mark Yates admitted that he could not meet the players wage demands . Carter denied this was the case , saying no contract negotiations took place and that he was left out of the crucial end-of-season run-in without any explanation . Northampton Town . Carter signed a two-year contract with Northampton Town in July 2013 . The club were still in League Two , having lost the play-off final to Bradford City . In his competitive debut for Northampton , at York City in the opening match of the campaign , he was sent off for a second bookable offence with 18 minutes to play , and his team lost 1–0 thanks to a last-minute goal . After two seasons at the club , and failing to hold down a first team place in 2014–15 , Carter was released by manager Chris Wilder . Forest Green Rovers . On 22 September 2015 , Carter signed for National League leaders Forest Green Rovers on a free transfer for the remainder of the season . He made his debut against his former club , second-placed Cheltenham Town , that same evening ; the match ended as a 2–2 draw . He continued in the starting eleven , and on his fourth appearance , his shot from the edge of the penalty area opened the scoring in the 3–0 win away to Aldershot Town . He scored his second goal for the club in an FA Cup first round away win over Football League club AFC Wimbledon on 7 November . He helped Forest Green reach the 2016 National League play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 15 May 2016 , and played the full 90 minutes in a 3–1 loss to Grimsby Town that denied the club a place in the Football League . The following day , newly appointed manager Mark Cooper offered him a new contract , of one year , which he accepted . He scored his first goal of the 2016–17 National League season on 27 August 2016 in a 4–1 win away to Maidstone United . He made 29 league appearances , scoring 4 goals , as Forest Green finished in the play-off positions .

On 28 June 2017 , Carter signed for National League club Solihull Moors on a free transfer . He went into the campaign with the attitude that I am going to play 40-odd games , and proceeded to do so . He was appointed captain , and missed only one match over the season as the team finished in the lower half of mid-table . Ahead of the 2018–19 season , he signed a one-year playing contract and was appointed manager of the clubs youth academy . He remained a regular in the team , playing in 44 of the 46 league matches as Moors finished second , three points behind Leyton Orient , and lost to AFC Fylde in the play-off semi-final . His consistency of performance earned him a place in the National League Team of the Season alongside Moors team-mate Jamey Osborne . International career . Carter represented the England under-20 team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship , and was capped 11 times in all at that level . In one match he was sent off for a foul on Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo . Style of play . Speaking in July 2005 , Bryan Robson stated that Carter has very good stamina and is very much a box-to-box player who can play in the centre of midfield or wide on the left . He is also left footed which gives us good balance in the squad , he has a good presence . Honours .

He was the first president of the American Philological Association and editor-in-chief of The Century Dictionary . Life . William Dwight Whitney was born in Northampton , Massachusetts on February 9 , 1827 . His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney ( 1786–1869 ) of the New England Dwight family . His mother was Sarah Williston ( 1800–1833 ) of Easthampton , Massachusetts . Whitney entered Williams College at fifteen , graduating in 1845 . He continued studying and worked at a bank in Northampton for several years . He was at first interested in natural sciences , and assisted his older brother Josiah Whitney on a geological survey of the Lake Superior region in 1849 , having charge of the botany , the barometrical observations and the accounts . On this expedition , he began the study of Sanskrit in his leisure hours . Around this time Whitney was living at Yale University in Connecticut . In 1850 , Whitney left the United States to study philology , and especially Sanskrit , in Germany . There , he spent his winters at Berlin studying under Franz Bopp and Albrecht Weber , and his summers were devoted to research under Rudolph von Roth at Tübingen . It was during his time in Germany that Whitney began a major life project , preparation of an edition and translation of the Atharva-veda . He gained wide reputation for his scholarship in the field . In 1853 , Yale University offered Whitney a position as Professor of Sanskrit , a position made just for him and the first of its kind in the United States . It was not until 1861 , however , that he received his doctoral degree from the University of Breslau . He also taught modern languages at the Sheffield Scientific School , and served as secretary to the American Oriental Society from 1857 until he became its president in 1884 . The American Philosophical Society elected Whitney to membership in 1863 . On August 28 , 1856 , Whitney married Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin . She was the daughter of Roger Sherman Baldwin , US Senator and Governor of the State of Connecticut . They had six children : 1 . Edward Baldwin Whitney was born August 16 , 1857 , became Assistant US Attorney General , and had son mathematician Hassler Whitney . 2 . Williston Clapp Whitney was born April 2 , 1859 but died March 11 , 1861 . 3 . Marian Parker Whitney was born February 6 , 1861 , became a professor of German at Vassar College and trustee of Connecticut College for Women 4 . Roger Sherman Baldwin Whitney was born January 6 , 1863 , but died January 17 , 1874 . 5 . Emily Henrietta Whitney was born August 29 , 1864 . 6 . Margaret Dwight Whitney was born November 19 , 1866 . He died at his home , on Whitney Avenue , on June 7 , 1894 . Career . Whitney revised definitions for the 1864 edition of Websters American Dictionary , and in 1869 became a founder and first president of the American Philological Association . In the same year he also became Yales professor of comparative philology . Whitney also gave instruction in French and German in the college until 1867 , and in the Sheffield scientific school until 1886 . He wrote metrical translations of the Vedas , and numerous papers on the Vedas and linguistics , many of which were collected in the Oriental and Linguistic Studies series ( 1872–74 ) . He wrote several books on language , and grammar textbooks of English , French , German , and Sanskrit . His Sanskrit Grammar ( 1879 ) is notable in part for the criticism it contains of the Ashtadhyayi , the Sanskrit grammar attributed to Panini . Whitney describes the Ashtadhyayi as containing the facts of the language cast into the highly artful and difficult form of about four thousand algebraic-like rules ( in the statement and arrangement of which brevity alone is had in view at the cost of distinctness and unambiguousness ) . In his Course in General Linguistics in the chapter on the Immutability and Mutability of the Sign , Ferdinand de Saussure credits Whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of linguistic signs . The linguist Roman Jakobson ( Jakobson 1965 , 23-4 ) remarks that Whitney exerted a deep influence on European linguistic thought by promoting the thesis of language as a social institution . In his fundamental books of the 1860s and 1870s , language was defined as a system of arbitrary and conventional signs . This doctrine was borrowed and expanded by Ferdinand de Saussure , and it entered into the posthumous edition of his Course , adjusted by his disciples C . Bally and Albert Sechehaye ( 1916 ) . The teacher declares : On the essential point it seems to us that the American linguist is right : language is a convention , and the nature of the sign that is agreed upon remains indifferent . Jakobson writes , Arbitrariness is posited as the first of two basic principles for defining the nature of the verbal sign : The bond uniting the signifier with the signified is arbitrary . The commentary points out that no one has controverted this principle but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it the appropriate place . Although he suffered from a heart ailment in his later years , he was editor-in-chief of the first edition of the respected Century Dictionary , which appeared from 1889 to 1891 .

He sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1698 and 1728 , and was then raised to the peerage and sat in the House of Lords . He served as the prime minister of Great Britain from 1742 until his death in 1743 . He is considered to have been Britains second prime minister , after Robert Walpole , but worked closely with the Secretary of State , Lord Carteret , in order to secure the support of the various factions making up the government . Early life . Compton was the third son of the 3rd Earl of Northampton and his wife Mary Noel , daughter of Baptist Noel , 3rd Viscount Campden . He was educated at St Pauls and matriculated at Trinity College , Oxford on 28 February 1690 , aged 15 . Thereafter he was admitted into Middle Temple in 1687 . Political career . English House of Commons . Although his family were High Tories , Compton turned to the Whigs after a quarrel with his brother , the 4th Earl of Northampton . He first stood for Parliament at East Grinstead on the interest of his kinsman the Earl of Dorset at the 1695 English general election but was unsuccessful . He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Eye at a by-election on 3 June 1698 . In Parliament he soon stood out as prominent amongst the Whigs and began a partnership with Robert Walpole that would last for over forty years . He was returned unopposed for Eye at the two general elections of 1701 and in 1702 and 1705 . Paymaster of Pensions . In 1707 Compton became Paymaster of Pensions , a post that he retained for the next six years . He was returned unopposed again at the 1708 British general election and was particularly active in Parliament thereafter . He remained as chairman of the committee of privileges and elections , and was a teller on the Whig side in many divisions . He managed several bills and on 14 December 1709 was nominated to the committee to draw up the articles of impeachment against Dr Sacheverell . At the 1710 British general election he was dropped as a candidate for Eye by his patron Lord Cornwallis after a disagreement , and he was unwilling to risk standing anywhere else because of his involvement with the Sacheverell case . However he retained his post as Paymaster of Pensions after the Tory government took office in that year . It is believed that the Tories retained him because they sought to maintain the support of the Compton family . At the 1713 British general election he was returned as Whig MP for East Grinstead and when the Whigs took power in 1715 he was hopeful that he would enter a high office . Speaker of the Commons . Instead of the high political office he had hoped for , Compton received the Court appointment of Treasurer to the Prince of Wales ( later George II ) ; shortly afterwards , however , he was unanimously elected as Speaker of the House of Commons . He held this post from 1715 to 1727 . In 1716 , he was invested a Privy Counsellor . He maintained the role of Speaker despite the split in the Whigs in 1717 , in which he joined the Walpole-Townshend alliance and found himself in opposition to the government of the day . He managed to maintain his position though until 1720 , when the split ended . Compton had a reputation for being a lax Speaker , once telling an MP who complained of being interrupted , No sir , you have a right to speak , but the House have a right to judge whether they will hear you . When Walpole became the leading minister of the day in 1721 there was speculation about his future should George I pass away and be succeeded by his son , who was more favourably inclined towards Compton than Walpole and declared that he would replace the latter with the former on accession . In order to avoid this , Walpole sought to keep Compton on the margins of government , though he was appointed as Paymaster of the Forces , a very lucrative post , from 1722 until 1730 . In 1725 , Compton entered Walpoles government as Lord Privy Seal and was also created a Knight of the Bath . Missed chance . In 1727 , George II succeeded to the throne and sought to bring about the change in leadership he had promised . However , Compton was not perceived as a man of great ability . He was described by a contemporary as a plodding , heavy fellow , with great application but no talents . In particular he proved unable to compete with Walpoles proposals for an allowance for the King . At a meeting between the three , Compton declared he was not up to the task of government . He maintained a hatred of Walpole for the humiliation . With this passed his last serious chance of holding real control over policy , and his influence sharply declined as a result . He remained on very close terms with George , but the era when Kings could personally select their own ministers in defiance of parliament was ending . House of Lords and Patriot Whigs . In order to remove him from the Commons , Walpole raised Compton to the peerage as Baron Wilmington , of Wilmington in the County of Sussex on 8 January 1728 ; two years later , on 14 May 1730 , he was created Viscount Pevensey , of Pevensey in the County of Sussex and Earl of Wilmington and was appointed Lord President of the Council in December of that year . He became increasingly associated with the Patriot Whigs , those most critical of Walpole , but in Parliament generally stuck to the official line of the ministry . In 1730 he attempted to form a coalition between the Patriot Whigs and the Hanoverian Tories to bring down Walpole , but this failed and he continued in office . However , during the Excise Crisis of 1733 , he failed to carry through a threat to resign , after being bought off with the promise to make him a Knight of the Garter , which he duly was . This further weakened any following he still commanded . He served as Lord President until 1742 . He was involved in the creation of the Foundling Hospital in 1739 , which was an orphanage for abandoned children . This charity became the capitals most popular way to prove ones philanthropic credentials and had very distinguished Board members ( including Wilmington ) . Prime Minister . In January 1742 he succeeded Walpole as First Lord of the Treasury and head of the Carteret ministry . Wilmington was a forceful Prime Minister , and grew notorious amongst his cabinet for taking measures without reaching consensus . His strong work ethic took its toll , and his health gradually deteriorated . He remained in office until his death , when he was succeeded by the Paymaster of the Forces , Henry Pelham . Private life . He bought the East Borne estate in Eastbourne , Sussex in 1724 and renamed it Compton Place . He engaged the architect Colen Campbell ( and after Campbells death William Kent ) to rebuild the house . It was completed in 1731 . He never married and died without issue , therefore all his titles became extinct upon his death . Over 1110 items from his large and valuable library were auctioned by Christopher Cock over 10 evenings , from to 27 February to 7 March 1733 . He was buried at the family seat of Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire . Compton Place passed to his nephew , James Compton , 5th Earl of Northampton . Legacy . The cities of Wilmington , Delaware , and Wilmington , North Carolina ; the towns of Wilmington , Massachusetts , and Wilmington , Vermont ; and , secondarily , the neighbourhood of Wilmington , Los Angeles , are named in his honour .

Bentley Professor Emeritus of Political Science . He and his wife , the economist Elinor Ostrom , made numerous contributions to the field of political science , political economy , and public choice . The Ostroms made particular study of fragmentation theory , rational choice theory , federalism , common-pool resources and polycentrism in government . The Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization published a special issue , Polycentric Political Economy : A Festschrift for Elinor and Vincent Ostrom , as the proceedings of a 2003 conference held in their honor , at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University . Education and personal life . Vincent Ostrom graduated from Mount Baker High School in Deming , Washington ( 1937 ) , and attended Los Angeles City College ( 1938–1940 ) . He received a B.A . in political science ( 1942 ) and a M.A ( 1945 ) from the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) . He received his Ph.D from UCLA in political science in 1950 . He was married to Nobel Laureate and political scientist Elinor Ostrom ( 1933–2012 ) from 1963 until her death , which occurred shortly before his own . Career . Ostrom began working at Indiana University in 1964 as a Professor of Political Science and co-founded the universitys Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis with his wife and colleague , Elinor Ostrom . The Ostrom Workshop is committed to the collaborative engagement of faculty , students , and scholars , with a mission of advancing the interdisciplinary study of institutions , incentives , and behavior as they relate to policy-relevant applications . The Ostrom Workshop research focuses on polycentrism , common-pool resources , and the roles of self-governance and collective action . Earlier in his career , Ostrom had held faculty positions at the University of Wyoming , the University of Oregon , and UCLA . He was a key consultant to the Alaska Constitutional Convention ( 1955–56 ) in the drafting of the Natural Resource Article of the , which mandated that the states resources were to be a public trust . Ostrom served on the editorial board for journals such as American Political Science Review ( 1957–1960 ) , Public Administration Review ( Editor-in-Chief , 1963–1966 ) , Publius : The Journal of Federalism ( 1972–2005 ) , Constitutional Political Economy ( 1989–present ) , and International Journal of Organization Theory and Behavior ( 1997–2006 ) . Research . Ostroms work can be summarized as seeking to understand the decision-making process of individuals and the balance between group and individual interests . This study involves attention to what drives human behavior ( altruism or self-interest ) , the effect of institutions and rules on individual and group behavior , and how institutions transform and are transformed by individuals . Ostrom co-developed ( with Charles Tiebout and Robert Warren ) and refined the concept of polycentricity in public administration – or multiple , formally independent decision-making centers within a system of government . He proposed that quasi-market conditions ( i.e . competition ) between decision centers would increase flexibility and responsiveness . In contrast to hierarchical frameworks , polycentrism removes government from the focal point of ultimate knowledge and authority . Ostrom was recognized for advancing rational choice theory and democratic administration not only as a means for understanding bureaucratic behavior and the provision of public services , but as a distinct theory of public administration . Rational choice theory of administration , Ostrom argued , provides a balance and foundation for public administration based on the democratic principles of the U.S . Constitution . In his 1973 book , The Intellectual Crisis in Public Administration , Ostrom outlines his observation of a breaking down of the intellectual foundation of public administration as formulated by Woodrow Wilson , concisely , the concentration of power centers in government and the separation of the will of the state ( policy ) from administration . He noted increases in citizen involvement in decision processes and the broad diffusion of power . A democratic administration has a more heterogeneous , bottom , up character in contrast with ordered , trickle-down hierarchies . Ostrom considered the hierarchical order , accountable to a single center of power , less capable of serving the diverse needs among citizens and coping with diverse conditions , and less cost efficient than a polycentric administration . Fragmentation of authority among decision centers within a jurisdiction and the overlapping of jurisdictional authority are key to advancing human welfare and a stable political order . Awards . Ostrom was honored for his excellence and contributions to the field of public policy : - 1991 – The Daniel Elazar Distinguished Scholar Award from the American Political Science Association for his lifetime of contributions to the study of federalism and intergovernmental relations . - 1999 – The Martha Derthick Best Book Award from the American Political Science Association , which is awarded for books published at least ten years prior with lasting contributions to the study of federalism and intergovernmental relations .

Aldred ; 5 November 1886 – 16 October 1963 ) was a British anarchist communist and a prominent member of the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation ( APCF ) . He founded the Bakunin Press publishing house and edited five Glasgow-based anarchist periodicals : The Herald of Revolt , The Spur , The Commune , The Council , and The Word , where he worked closely with Ethel MacDonald and his later partner Jenny Patrick . Early life . Aldred was born in Clerkenwell , London . His father was a 22-year-old lieutenant in the Royal Navy , and his mother was Ada Caroline Holdsworth , a 19-year-old parasol maker . Although Ada was socially unacceptable to the young naval officer , he married her shortly before Guys birth . After the wedding , he left her at the church to return to his mother . Guy Fawkes night , 5 November , gave Guy his forename . Guy was brought up in the home of Ada’s father , Charles Holdsworth , a Victorian radical . He attended the Iron Infants School in Farringdon Road , later moving to the Hugh Middleton Higher Grade School , where he was presented to the Prince of Wales because he was the youngest pupil . One of his fellow pupils was the son of Hermann Jung , the Swiss watchmaker and one-time activist in the First International . His first adventures in propaganda were with the Anti-Nicotine League , the Band of Hope , and the total abstinence movement , and he remained an abstainer in these respects all his life . His grandfather , an Anglican , encouraged him to attend the church of St Anne and St Agnes , where he took communion in 1894 . However , he soon developed a critical attitude to the church , even though he was close to his cousin , a curate at Holloway . At the age of 15 ( 1902 ) , he was made aware of his London provincialism when Madho Singh II , the Maharaja of Jaipur , visited the city . He became fascinated by the newspaper accounts of the Maharaja moving around with his travelling god : Later that year he gained a reputation as a Boy Preacher , printing and handing out his own leaflets , which were often received with ridicule and disdain . He found employment as an office boy with the National Press Agency in Whitefriars House , where he was promoted to sub-editor . Working with an evangelist named McMasters , he co-founded the Christian Social Mission , opening shortly after his 16th birthday as the Holloway Boy Preacher . His non-conformist approach aroused concern following his first sermon . After contacting Charles Voysey , Guy was eventually granted an audience on 20 December 1902 . The 74-year-old well-to-do Voysey was surprised to be confronted with a coarse-dressed 16-year-old working class boy . After careful preliminaries on the part of Voysey , the meeting lasted three hours . Their friendship was to continue until Voysey’s death in 1912 . In January 1903 the Reverend George Martin , an Anglican priest , visited Guy with one of his leaflets , asking to meet the Holloway Boy Preacher . Martin worked in London’s worst slums , and Guy joined him in his work with London’s poorest . His friendship with Martin lasted six years and influenced Guy strongly . He soon gave his last sermon from the pulpit and left the Christian Social Mission . Agnosticism . Guy became a speaker at the Institute of Theism , but soon felt it was time to set up his own organisation . In 1904 he founded the Theistic Mission , which met every Sunday . With a considerable , though sometimes boisterous , crowd , Guy was gaining a reputation as a forceful young orator . He was also shifting towards atheism . By August , the meeting banner was changed to read The Clerkenwell Freethought Mission . Meetings often generated extreme hostility . On one occasion the crowd charged the platform , knocking Guy to the ground and beating him . Police intervention put an end to the meeting . Around this time he became interested in The Agnostic Journal and became friendly with its editor , Saladin , a Scotsman . It was at the Journal’s office that he met another Scotsman , John Morrison Davidson , and Guy became more interested in Scottish affairs . Indian Sedition Trial , 1907 . The Indian Sociologist was an Indian nationalist newspaper edited by Shyamji Krishnavarma . When Krishnavarma left London for Paris , fearing repression by the authorities , the printing of the newspaper was first taken over by Arthur Fletcher Horsley . However , he was arrested and tried for printing the May , June and July issues . ( He was tried and sentenced on the same day as Madan Lal Dhingra , who was convicted of the assassination of Sir William Hutt Curzon Wyllie ) . At Horseleys prominent trial the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Alverstone , indicated that anyone printing that sort of material would be liable for prosecution . Nevertheless , Aldred , as an advocate of the free press , published it , bearing his own name . The police obtained a warrant and seized 396 copies of the issue . At the trial the prosecution was led by the Attorney General , Sir William Robson , at the Central Criminal Court . Robson highlighted parts of TIS which Aldred had himself written , particularly focussing on a passage which touched on the execution of Dhingra : Aldred also remarked that the Sepoy Mutiny , or Indian Mutiny , would be described as The Indian War of Independence . Aldred received a sentence of twelve months hard labour . His involvement with The Indian Sociologist brought him into contact with Har Dayal , who combined anarchism with his Indian Nationalism , based on his view of ancient Aryan culture and Buddhism . Socialism and anarchism . Aldred joined the Social Democratic Federation , but left in 1906 . He was a political conscientious objector during the First World War and also a founder of the Glasgow Anarchist Group . He initiated the Communist Propaganda Groups , in support of the October Revolution , which subsequently became a component of the Communist League in 1919 . Following its collapse , he founded the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation ( APCF ) in 1921 , and gradually moved towards opposing the Soviet Union . His links with left communists across Europe brought him close to council communism . In 1932 he split with the APCF and later founded the Workers Open Forum , which eventually became the United Socialist Movement . During World War II the USM worked with people from across the political spectrum to oppose military action , in a form of Popular Front , and came to advocate World Government . After Joseph Stalins death , Aldred became increasingly supportive of the Soviet Union . Free love . Aldred worked closely with his partner Rose Witcop ( 9 April 1890 – 4 July 1932 ) , a pioneer of birth control and sister of Milly Witkop ( who was , in turn , partner of anarchist Rudolf Rocker ) . Together they published an edition of Margaret Sangers Family Limitation , an action which saw them denounced by a London magistrate for indiscriminate publication and , despite expert testimony from a consultant to Guys Hospital and evidence at the appeal that the book had only been sold to those aged over twenty-one , the stock was ordered to be destroyed . Their case had been strongly supported by Dora Russell who , with her husband Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes , paid the legal costs of the appeal . Aldred and Witcop had a son , Annesley , in 1909 . Although they were drifting apart by the time Aldred settled permanently in Glasgow in 1922 , finally parting in 1924 , they had a legal marriage on 2 February 1926 , when it seemed possible Witcop might be deported for her continuing work on family planning . Death and legacy . After initially refusing hospital treatment for a heart condition , Guy Aldred died , almost penniless , in the Western Infirmary , Glasgow , on 16 October 1963 aged 76 , leaving his body to Glasgow Universitys Department of Anatomy . His remains were cremated at the Maryhill Crematorium , Glasgow on 4 May 1964 .

His playing position was defender and midfielder . He started his club career in his native Czech Republic , winning six league titles in seven years with Sparta Prague . He headed abroad to continue his football career , spending eight years playing for various teams including CSKA Moscow , Chelsea , Birmingham City , Celtic , Krylia Sovetov and Real Zaragoza . During this time he won league titles in four countries . He then returned to Sparta , although only for two seasons , after which he headed to Spain to play for Deportivo Alavés . Jarošík played for the Czech national team , making 23 appearances without scoring between 2000 and 2005 . Club career . Early career . Born in Ústí nad Labem , then Czechoslovakia , Jarošík began his career with Sparta Prague in his native Czech Republic . He had a two-year loan spell at Slovan Liberec before establishing himself in the first team at Sparta . Jarošíks appearances caught the eye of CSKA Moscow , who paid a then Russian record of about $3.5 million to acquire him in 2003 . Chelsea . On 6 January 2005 , Jarošík was purchased by Premier League club Chelsea for an undisclosed fee , thought to be about £3 million . On 27 February , he started the League Cup final , which Chelsea won 3–2 against Liverpool . Chelsea won the 2004–05 Premier League title and Jarošík made enough league appearances ( 14 ) to earn a championship medal . Birmingham City . In August 2005 , after Chelsea purchased Michael Essien , Jarošík found himself out of the first team and was loaned to fellow Premier League side Birmingham City for the 2005–06 season . At Birmingham , he was the teams joint-top goalscorer , albeit with just eight goals , becoming better known for his long-range shooting than the defensive responsibilities which gave him his name at Moscow . After finishing a disappointing season for the Midlands side , Birmingham had the option to make the deal permanent when the spell ended , but following their relegation , they did not do so . He finished his loan period at St Andrews in May 2006 , and returned to Chelsea not knowing where his future would lie , due to there being heavy competition for places at the club . Celtic . On 19 June 2006 , Jarošík left Chelsea and signed a three-year deal with Scottish Premier League champions Celtic for an undisclosed fee , rumoured to be around the £2 million mark . He scored on his Celtic debut in a 4–1 victory over Kilmarnock at Celtic Park . Competition from other midfielders such as Evander Sno , Aiden McGeady and Paul Hartley meant that first team opportunities were limited for Jarošík , but he still made several notable contributions to Celtics success , including winning both the free kicks from which Shunsuke Nakamura scored in the two Champions League group stage matches against Manchester United – the second put Celtic into the last 16 . On 6 December 2006 , Jarošík also scored Celtics goal in a 3–1 Champions League group stage loss at Copenhagen . On 14 January 2007 , Jarošík scored the winner in a 2–1 win over Hearts . Celtic won the 2006–07 league title in Jarošíks first season with the club , meaning that he had won league medals in a record four countries – Czech Republic , Russia , England and Scotland . Despite the signings of Massimo Donati and Scott Brown for the 2007–08 season , which made midfield competition even tighter than before , Jarošík remained with Celtic . On 3 October , Jarošík made his first Celtic start in over six months in Celtics 2–1 Champions League group stage victory over A.C . Milan at Celtic Park . On 28 November , Jarošík scored Celtics equaliser in another Champions League group stage match – this time against Shakhtar Donetsk – with a spectacular left-footed volley .

Born in Glasgow , McLeish played as a central defender for Aberdeen during their 1980s glory years , making nearly 500 League appearances for the club , and won 77 caps for Scotland . McLeish started his managerial career with spells at Motherwell and Hibernian , before guiding Rangers to two championships and five cup wins in five years . McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the 2008 UEFA European championship . He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of Birmingham City , who were in the Premier League at the time . Though Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season , McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009 . Birmingham then won the 2011 Football League Cup Final , but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season . Following this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals , Aston Villa . This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa , and only the second manager after Ron Saunders to manage both clubs . Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011–12 Premier League season , his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season . McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club Nottingham Forest in December 2012 , but left after 40 days by mutual consent . He managed Belgian Pro League club Genk in the 2014–15 season , and Zamalek of the Egyptian Premier League in 2016 . He then had a second stint as Scotland national team manager . In recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport , in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen . Early years . McLeish was born in Duke Street Hospital , Glasgow to parents Alex , a shipyard worker , and Jean . He has younger siblings Angela and Ian . After living in the Parkhead and Kinning Park districts of the city , the family moved to Barrhead , Renfrewshire soon after McLeish had reached school age . He attended Springhill Primary , Barrhead High School – where he was one year below future Aberdeen and Scotland teammate Peter Weir – and John Neilson High School in Paisley . As a juvenile he played for Barrhead Youth Club , alongside Weir , and Glasgow United as well as training for a short period with Hamilton Accies . After a local cup final with Glasgow United in 1976 which was watched by a delegation from Aberdeen , including then manager Ally MacLeod , McLeish signed for the Pittodrie club the following day . Playing career . Club . McLeish spent the majority of his first two seasons at Aberdeen in the reserves and also had a loan spell at local Junior side Lewis United . He made his competitive debut under Billy McNeill in a New Year fixture against Dundee United on 2 January 1978 . His first major final appearance was under the management of Alex Ferguson as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat to Rangers in the 1978–79 League Cup and most of his appearances during the 1970s were as a midfielder , with Willie Garner and Doug Rougvie preferred in defence . However McLeish eventually made the centre-back position his own , and over the next seven seasons he enjoyed great success , winning eight domestic and two European trophies . Highlights included scoring in a 4–1 victory over Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup Final on his 200th Dons appearance , and a vital goal against Bayern Munich during the campaign leading to the European Cup Winners Cup win over Real Madrid in 1983 . During this period , McLeish formed a formidable defensive triumvirate with Willie Miller and Jim Leighton for both club and country . Even after he had won his first Scotland cap , McLeishs father asked then Aberdeen boss Alex Ferguson to persuade him to continue training as an accountant . When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to Manchester United , he tried to get McLeish to sign , but it did not work out ; he also had talks with Tottenham Hotspur . A testimonial match was arranged for McLeish in December 1988 , with the clubs Gothenburg ( Cup Winners Cup ) squad taking on an International legends team . He won the Scottish player of the year in 1990 , after a season in which Aberdeen won both domestic cups . He became captain of Aberdeen after the retirement of Willie Miller . His 692 competitive appearances for the club ranks as the second-most in its history ( 100 behind Miller , but almost 100 more than Bobby Clark ) . International . McLeish is Scotlands third most capped player , having gained 77 international caps between 1980 and 1993 . He was first capped for the Scotland under-21 team while still a reserve player at Aberdeen by his former club manager Ally MacLeod , eventually gaining six caps at that level . His full international debut came on 26 March 1980 against Portugal , manager Jock Stein playing him in midfield alongside Archie Gemmill and Graeme Souness . He played in three World Cups with Scotland , in 1982 , 1986 and 1990 . He is a member of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame , the Scotland national football team roll of honour and Scottish Televisions fan poll Scotlands Greatest Team . On the occasion of his 50th cap , against Luxembourg in 1987 , McLeish was appointed team captain for the game . His final cap came on 17 February 1993 in a 3–0 win over Malta at Hampden Park during the 1994 World Cup qualifiers . Management career . Motherwell . After his successful playing career he quickly went into football management with Motherwell in 1994 , one year before he retired as a player . His first season at Motherwell saw him take the Lanarkshire club to second in the Premier Division behind Walter Smiths Rangers . However , he failed to build on this success and the next two seasons were spent in relegation battles . He resigned as manager to take over at Hibernian in 1998 . Hibernian . McLeish took over a struggling Hibernian side , which was relegated from the Scottish Premier Division in 1998 despite a slight upturn in fortunes under McLeish . He then guided the Edinburgh team back to the Scottish Premier League at the first attempt by winning the First Division championship . Hibernian consolidated in their first season back in the top division , finishing mid-table and reaching the Scottish Cup semi-final . In the 2000–01 season , Hibs started very strongly . Eventually they had to settle for third place and a Scottish Cup final appearance . This performance attracted the attention of bigger clubs , including West Ham United and Rangers . McLeish attracted players such as Russell Latapy and former French international Franck Sauzée to Hibs . He also helped develop young striker Kenny Miller , who would later go on to play for Scotland . During this period McLeish worked towards and was awarded a UEFA Pro Licence . Rangers . His work at Hibs was noticed , and he was linked with several moves to England , before he was appointed as Rangers manager in December 2001 after outgoing Rangers manager Dick Advocaat recommended McLeish to chairman David Murray . McLeish was an instant success at Rangers , winning both the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup in his first season , but the big prize of the league title was essentially lost before his arrival . His second season saw him go one better when he won the domestic treble , with the help of players such as Ronald de Boer and Barry Ferguson . Rangers worsening financial state saw many of his top players leave in the summer of 2003 . Celtic won the league comfortably in season 2003–04 , and Rangers failed to win any trophies . McLeish was consequently put under pressure from fans after his poor signings and a record run of seven consecutive Old Firm derby losses to Celtic . The high-profile Bosman signings of Jean-Alain Boumsong and Dado Pršo in the close season of 2004–05 gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtics grasp . McLeishs team won the 2005 league title on a dramatic last day , an outcome that had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining . After this unexpected success , McLeish and his Rangers team headed into the 2005–06 SPL campaign as favourites to retain the championship . McLeish made a number of signings , including Julien Rodriguez and Ian Murray , despite having little money to spend . After a reasonable start to the season , including a win over Celtic , Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November . This period included a club record of 10 games without a win . However the tenth match of this run , a 1–1 draw with Inter Milan in the Champions League , took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time . Despite the poor domestic form , McLeish guided Rangers to the last 16 of the Champions League , where they were defeated on the away goals rule by Villarreal . They became the first Scottish team to progress this far in the European Cup since 1993 , and the first Scottish team to progress through a European group stage . In December , chairman David Murray publicly announced his support for McLeish . Rangers then went on a good run of results in December and January . This run of good results came to a sudden halt when they were defeated 3–0 by Hibernian in the Scottish Cup , prompting protests outside Ibrox against both McLeish and David Murray . On 9 February 2006 , it was announced by chairman David Murray that McLeish would be standing down as manager at the end of that season . It was later announced that he would be succeeded by former Olympique Lyonnais manager Paul Le Guen . Rangers beat Hearts 2–0 at Ibrox Stadium in his final match as manager . Scotland national team . McLeish said after leaving Rangers that he would not manage another Scottish club , because he felt that he had achieved everything in the Scottish game . He was linked in the media with a number of managerial positions in England while he worked as a television pundit for the BBC and Setanta Sports . McLeish took charge of the Scotland national team on 29 January 2007 . His assistants in the job were Roy Aitken and Andy Watson . McLeishs first game in charge of the national team was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match , a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 24 March 2007 at Hampden Park . His second game was an away fixture against Italy on 28 March 2007 which ended in a 2–0 defeat . McLeishs Scotland side then went on to defeat the Faroe Islands away in June , Lithuania at home in September before recording a historic victory in Paris four days later by defeating France 1–0 in the Parc des Princes . James McFaddens 64th-minute strike from 30 yards was enough to earn Scotland the win and returned them to the top of Group B with three games to play . This result has been hailed as one of the Scotland national teams greatest victories . Scotlands next success was at home to Ukraine , winning 3–1 at Hampden on 13 October . McLeish suffered his second defeat as manager , away in Georgia on 17 October . This result left Scotland facing a decider against the World Champions , Italy . Scotland lost the game 2–1 , McLeishs last , and Italy qualified for the finals . Birmingham City . Premier League club Birmingham Citys approach to the SFA for permission to speak to McLeish about their managerial vacancy was refused , but on his return on 27 November 2007 from attending the draw for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification in South Africa , he resigned his post as manager of Scotland and was announced as Birminghams new manager the following day . His assistants with Scotland , Roy Aitken and Andy Watson , were to accompany him . McLeish said he wanted to return to working with players on a daily basis and had always harboured a desire to manage in the Premier League . He enjoyed a positive managerial debut with Birmingham , winning 3–2 away to Tottenham Hotspur . In the January 2008 transfer window , McLeish strengthened Birminghams squad , buying David Murphy and James McFadden and signing Argentina under-20 international Mauro Zárate on loan , while generating funds by allowing fringe players to leave . He was unable to save Birmingham from relegation , despite the team recording an impressive 4–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers on the last day of the season . McLeish changed the clubs backroom staff and training procedures , appointed David Watson as goalkeeping coach , and overhauled the scouting setup , bringing in Paul Montgomery – the scout who recommended a relatively unknown Didier Drogba to West Ham United – to oversee player recruitment . On the final day of the 2008–09 season , McLeish secured Birminghams return to the top flight of English football at the first attempt with a 2–1 away victory over Reading . By mid-January 2010 , he had guided them to a 12-game unbeaten run , a club record in the top division , set a Premier League record by selecting the same starting eleven for nine consecutive games , and been named Premier League Manager of the Month for December 2009 , the first Birmingham manager to receive the award . By the end of the season McLeish had led Birmingham to ninth place , their highest finish for more than 50 years . Following Birminghams success during the 2009–10 season , McLeish agreed a new three-year deal with the club in September 2010 . In February 2011 , McLeish led Birmingham to victory in the League Cup , defeating favourites Arsenal 2–1 in the final at Wembley in what he described as relatively speaking , .. . [ his ] greatest achievement . However , a poor run of form followed the League Cup win , and Birmingham were relegated to the Championship on the last day of the 2010–11 season . The directors confirmed that McLeish would keep his job , and would be expected to return the club to the Premier League at the first opportunity . McLeish however opted to quit Birmingham City on 12 June 2011 by email . Aston Villa . On 17 June 2011 , Aston Villa appointed McLeish as manager , just five days after leaving their local rivals Birmingham City . There was much controversy surrounding his appointment as Birmingham City claimed McLeish was still under contract and filed a complaint against Aston Villa to the Premier League while Villa claimed McLeish was a free agent . Aston Villa fans protested outside Villa Park and anti-McLeish graffiti had to be removed from outside Villas training ground . McLeish made out of favour Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given his first signing , and then recruited winger Charles NZogbia . McLeishs first competitive game as Villa manager ended in a 0–0 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage . He gained his first Premier League win as manager of Villa in a 3–1 win over Blackburn Rovers . Following victory over Blackburn , Villa drew their next four Premier League games until winning against Wigan 2–0 . Aston Villa finally ended their unbeaten start with a 4–1 defeat away at Manchester City . McLeishs side secured a surprise win over Chelsea just before signing LA Galaxy striker Robbie Keane on loan . Keane helped to secure Villa a crucial win against rivals Wolves in a 3–2 victory . McLeish led the 2011–12 Villa team to 16th place in the Premier League , avoiding relegation by two points , and set an unwanted club record of only four home wins . McLeishs contract was terminated on 14 May , the day after the season ended . The reasons cited for his termination were the poor results and style of play used throughout his term as manager . Nottingham Forest . McLeish was appointed manager of Football League Championship club Nottingham Forest on 27 December 2012 . His first game in charge was on 29 December 2012 , a 2–2 draw against Crystal Palace at the City Ground , with Billy Sharp scoring an injury-time equaliser for Nottingham Forest . McLeish earned his first win as Nottingham Forest manager on 12 January 2013 , a 2–1 victory against Peterborough at home . McLeish took charge of his only East Midlands derby against Derby County on 19 January 2013 , drawing 1–1 at Pride Park . On 2 February 2013 , after a 2–1 defeat to former club Birmingham City on his first return to St Andrews , he refused to commit his future to Nottingham Forest and claimed he was unhappy . This came after the Nottingham Forest board pulled out of a deal to sign George Boyd on the final day of the January transfer window . On 5 February 2013 , he left the club by mutual consent . Genk .

Leopold ( born 1927 ) is a paleobotanist and a conservationist . As a researcher in the United States Geological Survey , she aided in uncovering records of plant life from the Miocene around the Eniwetok and Bikini Atolls in the southern Pacific Ocean and from the Cenozoic era in the Rocky Mountains . As a professor of botany and forest sciences at the University of Washington , she directed the Quaternary Research Center , researched the forest history of the Pacific Northwest , and collaborated with Chinese paleobotanists . Leopolds work as a conservationist includes taking legal action to help save the Florissant Fossil Beds in Colorado , and fighting pollution . She is the daughter and only surviving child of Aldo Leopold . Education . Leopold was born in Madison , Wisconsin . She graduated with a degree in botany from the University of Wisconsin in 1948 , attained her masters in botany from the University of California , Berkeley in 1950 , and completed a Ph.D . in botany from Yale University in 1955 , where she studied with Paul B . Sears and Edward Smith Deevey , Jr. , two palynological pioneers in the United States , and also with G . Evelyn Hutchinson , an internationally known limnologist and ecologist . At Yale , Leopold began to specialize in studying pollen on a dare from an adviser . Her research involved extracting pollen and spores from ancient rocks and sediments and comparing this evidence of fossil plants with those of modern specimens in order to infer what past landscapes and environments were like . Work with United States Geological Society , 1955–1976 . On completing her Ph.D . in 1955 , Dr . Leopold took a job with the United States Geological Survey , where she worked for 21 years , from 1955 to 1976 . She made important findings about the effects of climate on the evolution and extinction of prehistoric plant species . In her work in the Rocky Mountains , she discovered that extinction and evolution of ancient species into newer varians was more prevalent in the middle of the continent because of the wider degree of seasonal changes ; in contrast , coastal areas with more moderate climates supported older species such as the giant redwood . Her work also included studying drilled cores containing pollen from the Miocene Epoch that revealed evidence of a tropical rainforest in the Eniwetok and Bikini Atoll area of the Pacific Ocean . By studying plant fossil records from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado , Idaho , and Wyoming , Leopold provided inferences about the paleoenvironment of the Paleogene and Neogene periods . The 34-million-year-old plant fossils preserved in the Florissant Valley , southwest of Denver and now part of the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument , yielded some of the key evidence for her studies . Conservation . Leopolds research in Colorado at the Florissant Fossil beds led her to become a leader in the effort to preserve the area containing this rich fossil evidence . The area was to be converted into a real estate development until she and several others filed suit . On August 20 , 1969 , the 6,000 acre area became the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument . Other conservation actions taken by Leopold include opposing oil shale development in western Colorado , stopping dams from being built in the Grand Canyon , and helping stop shipping of high-level nuclear materials through the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound . She serves on the board and has been president of the Aldo Leopold Foundation in Baraboo , Wisconsin . Honoraria . In 1969 , Leopold was awarded Conservationist-of-the-Year-Award by the Colorado Wildlife Federation . She was elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences in 1974 , and two years later she was awarded the Keep Colorado Beautiful annual award . She served as president of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1995 and as president of the American Quaternary Association from 1982–1984 ; is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the Geological Society of America , the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , and the American Philosophical Society ; was the associate editor of Quaternary Research from 1976–1983 and continues to work on the journals editorial board , as well as that of Quaternary International .

Chen worked in Shanghai for his entire public life , serving as mayor from 2001 to 2003 . Chen took on numerous mega-projects while he was mayor , including the mass expansion of the Shanghai Subway and the construction of the Yangshan Port . Chen contributed to the citys economic development and was instrumental in Shanghais bid to host the 2010 World Expo . Chen , a prominent member of the Shanghai clique , was also known for his political partisanship and opposition to the macro-economic control policies of the Hu-Wen Administration . In September 2006 , Chen was removed from office after a scandal came to light about the misuse of money in Shanghais social security fund ( see Shanghai pension scandal ) . He became the second incumbent Politburo member since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests to be expelled from the party . In April 2008 , Chen was sentenced to 18 years in prison upon conviction on charges of financial fraud and bribery . Rise to power . Chen graduated from the PLA Institute of Logistics Engineering , majoring in architecture . He had two years of experience working in the military between 1968 and 1970 as part of the PLA 6716 Squadron . From September 1970 to March 1983 , Chen worked at the Shanghai Pengpu Machinery Factory as a worker and estimator . He was eventually promoted to the capital construction branch vice-section chief . He also went on a year-long sabbatical to Tongji University . In March 1983 he was promoted to become deputy plant manager of the Shanghai Pengpu machine factory , as well as the party committee deputy secretary of the Shanghai Metallurgy Mining Machinery Company . He joined the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) in April 1980 . By March 1984 , Chen gained further promotion , becoming the CPC Secretary for Shanghais Electronic Appliances Bureau . Between January 1985 and February 1987 , he became bureau chief and assistant commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee – Old cadre bureau . In February 1987 , Chen gained a posting as the new magistrate for Huangpu District in Shanghai . He went on sabbatical studying public administration at the University of Birmingham from January to September 1992 through a UK government-funded Chevening Scholarship . Chen was promoted to be Deputy Mayor of Shanghai in 1996 , concurrently holding the CPC Vice-Secretary position . As then Party general secretary Jiang Zemin made his political manoeuvers before the 16th Party Congress in 2002 to strengthen the Shanghai power base with his loyalties , Chen became the beneficiary , replacing then-Mayor Xu Kuangdi , becoming Mayor of Shanghai in late 2002 , and Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee in February 2003 . He was therefore granted membership in the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee . As an ally of former general secretary Jiang Zemin , Chen was to keep Jiangs Shanghai base of power while Hu Jintao was given all official positions of power . Chen is believed to be linked to real estate magnate and banker Zhou Zhengyi in the Shanghai Real Estate scandals , where residents were forced to relocate for new housing developments where old-style apartments were being demolished to build modern-style condominiums . Mayor and party chief of Shanghai . Chen Liangyu became the CPC Committee Secretary for Shanghai in November 2002 , the citys top office . As is customary for the occupants of this office , he was also given a seat on the Politburo of the 16th CPC Central Committee . During Chens term in office , Shanghais economy grew rapidly , which contributed to significant improvements in the living standards of the citys residents . Economic growth . During Chens term in office , Shanghais average annual economic growth rate stood at about 13% , at the forefront of the country , the average annual revenue growth of over 20% , and over the years turned over to the proportion of the central finance more than 15% The annual import and export volume of the Port of Shanghai exceeded 400 billion U.S . dollars , at an average annual increase of over 30% . The cargo throughput of the port exceeded 500 million tons , ranking first in the world . Municipal infrastructure and large-scale industrial production construction projects proceeded at a rapid pace ; prominent examples include the Yangshan Deepwater Port ( Figure ) , the Shanghai World Financial Center , the Shanghai Metro , and Jiangnan Shipyard Changxing Island base , and the Shanghai Chemical Industrial Zone . These large scale projects cemented Shanghais position as the economic heart of the country . Improving the livelihood of the people and helping the poor . Urban traffic congestion and poor public transit had been a long-standing problem in Shanghai . Chen Liangyu was personally invested in the issue , and during his term in office Shanghai saw significant improvements to its transit system and transport infrastructure . As a result of the urban rail construction during Chens term , the Metro had overtaken buses as the main transport tool for most Shanghai residents . Additionally , Mr . Chen oversaw the construction of bridges and tunnels on the Huangpu River , such as the Lupu Bridge . Opening several new arterial bridges relieved pressure from existing bridges and tunnels , thus easing traffic jams . Due to historical reasons , the Shanghai area had large areas of shanty towns and old-fashioned neighborhoods , a large number of residents faced a housing shortage and poor living conditions . Chen Liangyu led the Shanghai municipal government in a vigorous urban transformation , in conjunction with the municipal engineering reasonable relocation and resettlement . This not only beautified the urban environment and improved the living conditions of the people , but it is also especially important due to the relocation and resettlement of the household population based on a per capita metric , which solved the housing problems of a large number of people , especially the impoverished , and reduced the burden of rising housing prices . Under Chen Liangyus leadership , pollution in the Suzhou River , which had long plagued Shanghai , came under management . The Suzhou River water pollution problem was greatly reduced . Additionally , the landscape around the Suzhou River underwent massive changes . Chen Liangyu as the party secretary of Shanghai repeatedly stressed the need to protect low-income and vulnerable members of society . Mr . Chen started at the grassroots and personally visited people who were less well-off ; he additionally supervised the implementation of policy measures combating poverty . Chen Liangyu also used a variety of tools to ensure the welfare of the people of Shanghai , including improve pensions and health insurance and other social security programs , develop measures to increase active employees and retirees income , and increased employment opportunities . Chen Liangyus attention and efforts on the issue of peoples livelihood helped Shanghai society maintain harmony and stability , the average life expectancy exceeded 80 years of age , and members of the public felt a greater sense of belonging and pride with regard to being residents of Shanghai . Reform , innovation , and opening wider to world . One of the landmarks of the Shanghai World Expo China Pavilion Night Scene With Shanghais economic development , the traditional model of development that relies on cheap labor and high energy consumption has become increasingly constrained further development . To this end , Chen Liangyu , Shanghai should improve the capability of independent innovation , economic growth by a resource-dependent to innovation-driven . Meanwhile , Chen Liangyu to implement the technological innovation and the city through science and education strategy , to increase investment in education , the proportion of Shanghai education and research funding has increased year by year , gradually improve the system of lifelong education , new The labor force average years of education for 14 years . In addition , Chen Liangyu , pioneering the development of a recycling economy in order to reduce the consumption of resources and strengthening environmental protection . These measures , so that the industrial structure of Shanghais overall progress , and the formation and the gradual consolidation of the core competitiveness during Shanghais economy has maintained double-digit growth , while energy consumption annual growth of only about 5% . In opening up , Chen Liangyu presided over planning the 2010 Shanghai World Expo – the bid , construction and preparation work , to develop a number of measures to support the Shanghai bid to host the World Expo and then to attract countries to the stadium stationed in Shanghai World Expo of Governments , and during , exhibitors Affairs made significant progress , confirmed exhibitors for the number of countries and international organizations to create a historical record . Meanwhile , Chen Liangyu vigorously the introduction of foreign capital , and other means to expand the level of opening up in Shanghai , to improve Shanghais international transparency , speed up Shanghai as an international metropolis , the pace of reconstruction . Cultural heritage and dialect protection . Shanghai primary school in Professor Shanghai dialect Shanghai was known as the lost culture Highland has a rich historical and cultural heritage , Chen Liangyu , that culture is the essence of a city , soul and lifeblood of focus on carrying forward the revival of Shanghais specialty boutique culture and emphasis on the protection of historic buildings in Shanghai . In addition , from the beginning of the 1990s , Shanghai vigorously promote Mandarin , Shanghai dialect as the core of local culture ( Shanghai culture ) has become increasingly subject to compression , an increasingly grim situation . As the leadership of Shanghai , Chen Liangyu , on this issue to take a more flexible method is relatively effective protection of the local culture and the Shanghai dialect , the Shanghai public affirmation . Counterpart support and regional cooperation . As the officials in charge of Chinas economic center Shanghai , Chen Liangyu advocate services nationwide , to support the economic construction of the other provinces and municipalities should be in the development of its own premise , in its term of office , the scale of foreign aid and economic cooperation expand personnel exchanges and mutual learning exchanges are becoming increasingly active . Controversy . Along with Mayor Han Zheng , Chen continued the CPCs reformation , and during his leadership , Shanghai was selected as the host city for Expo 2010 . Chen was officially credited with dramatically increasing the size and efficiency of Shanghais public transportation . Shanghais rising real estate prices have plagued the city since 2002 , and rose over 200% during Chens term in office as the citys Party Chief , as ordinary Shanghai citizens found it increasingly difficult to find a place to live . The real estate network had a history of being monopolized . The government had attempted to assert control , but because of the inevitable link between the government and private businesses , many deals were cut in which Chen was implicated . Chen also held major interests in the Shanghai Shenhua football squad , attending all of their home matches and even supervising some practices . His image in the city during his tenure as mayor was divisive . He initiated a series of gigantic projects to be finished in time for Shanghais hosting of the 2010 World Exposition , including shipping 128,000 tons of sand to create a beach in Shanghais suburbs , building a $209 million world-class tennis complex and a $300 million Formula One circuit racetrack . His most controversial project was the proposed Shanghai-Hangzhou mag-lev train . Opponents of Chen painted him as corrupt , short-tempered , and despotic during Municipal Committee meetings which he chaired . Supporters of Chen credited him with openness and saw him as a progressive leader crucial to Shanghais economic and social development on the international scene . Other observers saw Chen as an effective local administrator in Shanghai , but an impediment to nationwide equalization and macroeconomic controls ( otherwise known as 宏观调控 Hongguan Tiaokong ) . During his term , Chen sold massive amounts of land to his brother who resold the land for more than tenfold , becoming Shanghais real estate magnate . Chens son , Chen Weili , was made an executive of the Shanghai Shenhua football club shortly after graduating from university . Pension scandal . In August 2006 , Qin Yu , one of Chens top aides , was abruptly dismissed from his position as Baoshan District governor and arrested , charged with the misappropriation of $400 million of the citys pension funds . The citys social security coffers managed more than 10 billion yuan ( US$1.25 billion ) in assets . Instead of investing the money in low-risk government bonds and bank deposits , it was invested in expensive real estate and toll road projects around the city . It was suspected that the citys top leadership figures , including Chen , could be implicated in the scandal . During Chens term as party chief , he routinely pursued policies that drew friction from the partys central leadership and the policies of the general secretary Hu Jintao . Hus government favoured balanced regional economic development and feared social divisions resulting from a widening wealth gap , and thus attempted to rein in regional leaders who wanted to pursue rapid economic development which they viewed as overtly favoring regional economic interests . Chen reportedly clashed with Premier Wen Jiabao openly at a Politburo meeting in Beijing over the issue of economic development , indicating that Chen believed the Premier was standing in the way of Chinas economic development . Chens statements at municipal meetings also charted a new independent course ; Chen opposed the Communist Partys long-held convention that Marxism serves as the guiding scientific principle . Rather , Chen claimed to rely upon all forms of science – signaling he was at odds with the Communist Partys orthodoxy . On September 25 , citing alleged involvement in the pension scandal , Chen was dismissed as Shanghai party chief and suspended from his membership in the partys Central Committee and its Politburo . A team composed of some one hundred investigators from central authorities in Beijing was sent to Shanghai to investigate . Two days before his dismissal , Chen and mayor Han Zheng went to Beijing to meet with Hu Jintao . There Chen was detained , and only Han returned to Shanghai . The authorities carefully managed the transfer of authority in Shanghai . On the day of Chens dismissal , Han Zheng returned to Shanghai at 3 am and called an official meeting to deliver Beijings decision that Chen was suspended because of the scandal and that Han himself was assuming the post of acting party chief . Chen was charged with helping further the economic interests of illegal business people , protecting staff who severely violated laws and discipline and furthering the interests of family members by taking advantage of his official posts . There was also speculation that Chens sacking occurred for political reasons . Chen was a protégé of former general secretary Jiang Zemin and considered a core member of the Shanghai Clique . In carving out a local fiefdom for himself and willing to boldly deviate from the partys official economic policies , Chen was seen as a serious rival to general secretary Hu Jintao , and his dismissal was interpreted as a political victory for Hu . Chen was the highest-ranking Chinese official to be sacked since former Beijing party secretary Chen Xitong ( no relation ) was removed from office in 1994 on charges of corruption . The Shanghai pension scandal also led to the dismissal of the chief of the Municipal Labour and Social Security Bureau Zhu Junyi , and the downfall of several prominent businessmen , the executives of Shanghais biggest industrial conglomerate , and other city officials . For a period of time , it was also believed that the scandal would implicate the family and associates of then Vice-Premier and Politburo Standing Committee Huang Ju . However , Huang died in 2007 , and no case against him was ever pursued . After Han Zheng served a few months as acting party chief , Zhejiang party chief Xi Jinping was transferred to Shanghai to take over the position of party secretary . Xi would go on to become a member of the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007 and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012 . Expulsion and trial . In July 2007 , Chen was expelled from the Communist Party , and his case was transferred to judicial authorities . In comparison to the judicial action against Chen Xitong , Chens case proceeded at a much faster pace . During the investigation , Chen was placed under house arrest in Qinhuangdao , where he lived in a mansion and spent most of his time playing cards and reading , ordering his meals from menus . Thereafter , Chen was transferred to Qincheng Prison in the Changping District of Beijing . Chens trial began in late March 2008 . He was represented by Beijing lawyers Gao Zicheng and Liu Limu . He faced three charges : embezzlement , abuse of power , and dereliction of duty . Chen acknowledged that he was partially responsible for the pension fund scandal , but pleaded not guilty to the charges . However , he was found guilty by the court . Chen was largely cooperative during the court proceedings . At the end of the trial on March 25 , Chen stated I am sorry to the party , the people of Shanghai , and my family . On April 11 , 2008 , Chen , 61 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison for accepting 2.39 million yuan ( ~$340,000 ) in bribes and abusing power , specifically , for stock manipulation , financial fraud and his role in the city pension fund scandal , at the No . 2 Intermediate Peoples Court , Tianjin . Chen Liangyu’s 18 years imprisonment will end on July 25 , 2025 .</p><p>question: Chen Liangyu took which position from 2002 to Nov 2002?</p><p>pred: Mayor of Shanghai</p><p>context_time: Chen Liangyu ( ; born October 24 , 1946 in Shanghai ) is a Chinese politician best known for his tenure as the Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai , the citys top office , and a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China , from 2002 to 2006 .

He has previously played in the Premier League for West Ham United and Norwich City . Playing career . West Ham United . Ward was born in Harrow , Greater London , and came through the youth system of West Ham United , making his debut for the Under-17 side before joining the first team in August 2003 . In 2004 , Ward went out for two loan spells , at Peterborough United and Bristol Rovers in July and December 2004 respectively . Ward made an impact on the West Ham first team during the second half of the 2004–05 season , while the club were in the Football League Championship . Primarily due to injuries to more established defenders such as Christian Dailly and Malky Mackay , he found himself with the opportunity of partnering Anton Ferdinand in the centre of defence . When Ward was brought into the first team , for the 1–3 loss against Reading on 12 March 2005 , the club were lying outside the playoff places and looked unlikely to make it back to the Premiership . The pairing of Ward and Ferdinand enabled the team to remain unbeaten for the rest of the season . This unbeaten run included the three playoff games , thus ensuring their return to the Premiership for the following season . At the beginning of the 2005–06 season , to prepare for the upcoming Premiership campaign , West Ham signed a number of players , including central defenders Danny Gabbidon and James Collins from Cardiff City . Gabbidon became the preferred choice to partner Ferdinand , and this resulted in chances being few and far between for Ward . He played two League Cup games , but made only one substitute Premiership appearance ( against Bolton on 27 August 2005 ) before being loaned out to Plymouth Argyle in November . The month-by-month loan deal lasted three months , and after playing 16 games and scoring once against Wolves , Ward returned to The Hammers in February 2006 playing three further games towards the end of the 2005–06 season . Coventry City . Ward left West Ham in the summer of 2006 , joining Coventry City for £1m . Manager Micky Adams said of him : In Elliott we have a young , talented and confident defender who Im sure will bring a real presence to our back line . He is just the sort of player we are looking for to help the club progress . Ward made his debut for Coventry on 6 August 2006 in a 2–1 home win against Sunderland with his first goal coming on 12 September 2006 in a 2–1 away defeat to Ipswich Town . The next three seasons saw him play 39 , 37 and 32 league games for Coventry scoring 14 league goals but by season 2009–10 he was reduced to only eight games for the season . Having fallen down the pecking order at Coventry , in February 2010 he joined Doncaster Rovers on a one-month emergency loan after Rovers suffered injuries to several first team defenders . He made an instant impact at Doncaster , scoring an overhead kick goal on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough . He played only six league games for Doncaster before being signed by Preston North End manager Darren Ferguson , on loan until the end of the season , in March 2010 . He made only four league appearances for Preston before returning to Coventry City . Norwich City . On 26 May 2010 , Ward signed a two-year deal with Norwich City on a free transfer . His Norwich debut came on 6 August in the opening game of the 2010–11 season , a 2–3 home defeat to Watford . Ward picked up an injury in the 2–1 away win over Coventry City on 18 December , sidelining him until the end of January . He made his return to the team in the 2–1 win over Millwall on 1 February 2011 , scoring his first goal for the club to equalise . Ward played 39 of a possible 46 league games in Norwich Citys side which won promotion to the Premier League in 2010–11 season but in July 2011 , during a pre-season tour of Germany , Ward picked up a knee injury which kept him out of action until January 2012 . In October 2012 Ward joined Nottingham Forest on loan until 29 December 2012 , with a view to a permanent transfer . Ward returned to Norwich at the end of his loan spell and was named as a substitute for their FA Cup game away at Peterborough United . However , in January 2013 , after just over a week with Norwich , he returned on loan with Nottingham Forest . His first Forest goal came in his first game of his second loan spell , on 12 January 2013 . His headed goal in the 83rd minute from a Radosław Majewski cross saw Forest 2–1 winners against Peterborough United giving manager Alex McLeish his first win as Forest manager . Bournemouth . On 18 June 2013 Ward signed an initial one-year deal with Bournemouth following their promotion to the Championship . He made two league appearances during Bournemouths 2014–15 season after which they were promoted to the Premier League . His contract with Bournemouth was cancelled in January 2016 by mutual consent . Huddersfield Town ( loan ) . On 9 September 2015 , Ward signed on loan for Championship club Huddersfield Town for an initial period of a month . He made his Town début in the 2–0 loss against Cardiff City on 12 September . He played five games , before returning to Bournemouth , due to a knee injury .

They are located in Indianapolis , Indiana , and play their home games at Victory Field in downtown Indianapolis . The teams mascot is Rowdie the Bear . Founded in 1902 , the Indianapolis Indians are the second-oldest minor league franchise in American professional baseball ( after the Rochester Red Wings ) . The 1902 and 1948 Indians were recognized as being among the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time . History . The first attempt at professional baseball in Indianapolis came in the 1870s , when a club called the Indianapolis Blues operated in the National League in 1878 . After a hiatus , organized baseball began again in 1887 , and the city has hosted professional baseball nearly every year since then . After 15 years of various franchises competing in various leagues ( including four years in the National League and one year in the American Association ) , the current Indianapolis Indians franchise was founded as an original member of the American Association in 1902 . That years team won 95 games and the first of 21 pennants . The ballclub played its early seasons at several ballparks , including two on Washington Street , before Norm Perry , who took ownership of the team in 1929 , built a new stadium on 16th Street in 1931 , the Indians playing their first game there on September 5 , 1931 . He named the park Perry Stadium in honor of his brother James who had been killed in a plane crash . That ballpark was renamed Victory Field in 1942 , and Bush Stadium in 1967 , and remained the Tribes home until July 1996 . Norm Perry sold the team to Frank E . McKinney and Donie Bush in December 1941 . Those two men ran the club for 10 seasons . The Cleveland Indians purchased the team in 1952 , but after losing $500,000 on the operation over four seasons , looked to move the team . The Indianapolis community rallied to save the Indians . Funeral director Robert E . Kirby , Chairman of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Athletic Committee , obtained an option to purchase the franchise from Cleveland . A broad-based sale of stock in the team was organized . Stock was priced at $10 per share with a 100-share limit on individual purchases . Kirby , William R . Kraft , David M . Lewis , Thomas A . Moynahan , and Thomas J . OBrien got the ball rolling with investments of $200 each , and the certificate of incorporation for Indians , Inc . was received from the state of Indiana on November 9 , 1955 . Media promotion of the stock sale was intense . The Indianapolis Star , The Indianapolis News , and the Indianapolis Times ran complete lists of stock purchasers and their addresses . So successful was the drive that the original 16,000-share purchase authorization of capital stock was increased to 25,000 shares by the Secretary of State on December 5 following stockholder approval on November 30 . Eventually the new corporation stopped accepting investments in February after a total of 20,488 shares had been purchased by 6,672 investors . Former Indians player , manager , and owner Donie Bush was named the first President of Indians , Inc . He held that position until January 1969 . In 1956 , the Indianapolis Indians were 92–62 . On May 18 , they defeated the Louisville Colonels 24–0 . The Indians went on to win the 1956 Junior World Series by defeating the Rochester Red Wings . In Game 2 of the Junior World Series , Roger Maris set a record by getting seven RBIs . Max Schumacher joined the Indians front office as ticket manager in 1957 . He added the duties of publicity director in 1959 , and became the clubs general manager in 1961—a post he held through 1997 . Max was also named the teams President in 1969 following Bushs retirement . To this day , he continues as President and Chairman of the Board of Indians , Inc . Under his direction , the corporation has turned a profit for 35 straight years . The team captured three straight pennants from 1961 to 1963 , including the International League championship in 1963 . ( The Indians competed in the American Association until it briefly disbanded after 1962 . The Tribe joined the IL for one season before belonging to the Pacific Coast League from 1964 through 1968 . At that point the Indians rejoined the American Association. ) In 1969 , Vern Rapp joined as manager of the Indians for 7 years . During that time , the Indians won two American Association pennants . The Indians had been affiliated with several Major League clubs over the years including Cincinnati ( 1939–41 , 1961 ) , Boston Braves ( 1946–47 ) , Pittsburgh ( 1948–1951 ) , Cleveland ( 1952–1956 ) , Philadelphia ( 1960 ) and the Chicago White Sox ( 1962–67 ) . Beginning in 1968 they had a working agreement with the Cincinnati Reds that lasted through 1983 . In addition to four first-place finishes and one playoff championship in that time period , Indianapolis fans saw numerous members of The Big Red Machine come through town . Players like Pedro Borbón , Bernie Carbo , Dave Concepción , Dan Driessen , George Foster , Ken Griffey , Ray Knight , and Hal McRae all donned Tribe uniforms . The most glorious run in team history came in the 1980s after the team affiliated with the Montreal Expos . In a six-year period ( 1984–1989 ) , the Indians won four division titles , four straight league championships ( 1986–1989 ) and two consecutive Triple-A Classic playoffs ( 1988–1989 ) over the champions of the International League . Delino DeShields , Andrés Galarraga , Marquis Grissom , Randy Johnson , and Larry Walker played for Indianapolis during those years . The Indians affiliated again with Cincinnati from 1993 to 1999 , during which time the team won two more pennants and a league championship ( 1994 ) . In 1998 , Triple-A baseball expanded to 30 teams and consolidated into two leagues , with the Indians returning to the International League . After becoming the top affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2000 , the Indians won the league championship and went on to capture the Triple-A World Series in Las Vegas . But sub-.500 finishes during the next four seasons prompted the Indians to break from the Brewers and join the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system for the first time since 1951 . Perhaps the most significant change in Indians history came in 1996 when the team moved downtown to a new ballpark . Taking a name from the past , Victory Field , an $18 million project on the west side of downtown and part of White River State Park , opened on July 11 , 1996 , as the Tribe hosted the Oklahoma City 89ers . The open-air facility features 13,500 permanent seats and a lawn berm around the outfield that can seat up to 2,000 additional fans . The park also features 29 luxury suites . The ballpark was designed by the same architectural firm that designed Baltimores Camden Yards and Clevelands Jacobs Field . The opening of Victory Field took the Indianapolis Indians to a new level . Attendance nearly doubled with more than 600,000 fans coming to the ballpark in each of the first five full seasons . In January 1999 , Baseball America dubbed Victory Field the best minor league ballpark in America . Those accolades were reinforced in 2001 by Sports Illustrated and minorleaguenews.com . The national commendations and record attendance marks earned the Indians a share of the national spotlight . On July 11 , 2001 representatives from all 30 Triple-A teams came to Indianapolis , and a national TV audience watched on ESPN2 as the Triple-A All-Star Game took place in front of a sellout crowd of 15,868 . In 2017 , the Indians led all of Minor League Baseball in total attendance with 641,141 fans visiting Victory Field during the regular season . Twelve Indians players and or managers have enjoyed enough success at the Major League level to warrant induction into baseballs Hall of Fame . Those players are : Samuel Big Sam Thompson , Grover Cleveland Alexander , Luke Appling , Gabby Hartnett , Randy Johnson , Harmon Killebrew , Nap Lajoie , Al López , Rube Marquard , Joe McCarthy , Bill McKechnie , and Ray Schalk .

He began his career with Venezia , and then Palermo . In 2011 , he moved to Paris Saint-Germain . Twice voted the Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year , his honours at the club include four consecutive league titles and all four domestic competitions in both the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons . After spending the 2016–17 season on loan to Sevilla and Osasuna , he was signed by Torino in 2017 . A former Italy youth international , Sirigu made his Italy senior debut in 2010 , and was selected for UEFA Euro 2012 , the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup , 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016 . Club career . Early career . Born in Nuoro , Sardinia , Italy , Sirigu started his football career in Venezias youth system playing as a midfielder . He was known for his powerful back heels which he used to take penalty kicks . He had been training as an attacker for a local amateur side , Puri e Forti , at 11 years old , when coaches concluded that his asthma condition would hinder him too much as an outfield player . Instead , observing Sirigus unusually large hands , they told him to have a go in goal . Palermo . In 2002 , he joined Palermos youth system . In the 2006–07 season made his debut as a starter in a Coppa Italia match against Sampdoria and a UEFA Cup match against Fenerbahçe . Palermo loaned him to Serie C1 club Cremonese on 12 July 2007 to gain some first team experience . He spent the 2008–09 season on loan to Serie B side Ancona , but only played 15 games with his club , as Ancona managers Francesco Monaco , and later Sandro Salvioni preferred Brazilian Da Costa over him . Sirigu successively returned to Palermo as a second-choice keeper , behind new signing Rubinho , for the 2009–10 season . Following a string of unimpressive performances by Rubinho , Palermo coach Walter Zenga , himself a former goalkeeper who was noted for his ability , moved Sirigu in the starting role for the Week 6 game , an away match against Davide Ballardinis Lazio on 27 September 2009 . The game , which also represented Sirigus official debut in the Italian Serie A , ended in a 1–1 draw , with the young goalkeeper being nominated Man of the Match due to his numerous saves throughout the match . He was subsequently confirmed for the following game , where Sirigu managed to keep a clean sheet in a 2–0 win against Serie A giants Juventus . Since then , Sirigu was regularly featured in the starting line-up and permanently confirmed as first-choice goalkeeper , leading the club to send Rubinho out on loan to Livorno later in January . Due to his performance during his time at Palermo , Sirigu earned the nickname Walterino , a reference to his coach Walter Zenga , who is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time . On 21 October 2009 , Palermo announced to have agreed a contract extension with him , the new contract would have expired in June 2014 . His final appearance for Palermo came in the 2011 Coppa Italia Final against Internazionale at Romes Stadio Olimpico , a 3–1 loss . Paris Saint-Germain .

On 27 January 2013 , Sirigu broke Bernard Lamas clean-sheet record for a PSG goalkeeper in Ligue 1 ( 697 minutes ) . He became the first foreign player to be named UNFPs goalkeeper of the season as PSG won the 2012–13 Ligue 1 championship . Sirigu won the award for the second consecutive year in 2014 , with PSG defending their league title and winning the Coupe de la Ligue . On 2 August 2014 , as PSG won the Trophée des Champions 2–0 against Guingamp at the Workers Stadium in Beijing , Sirigu saved a 32nd-minute penalty kick from Mustapha Yatabaré . He signed a contract extension on 10 September of the same year , lasting until 2018 . Sirigu remained PSGs first choice goalkeeper in the 2014–15 season for Ligue 1 and UEFA Champions League matches , as the capital club won a domestic treble of the league championship , Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue , as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League . After PSG completed the signing of German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp from Eintracht Frankfurt in July 2015 , deputy sporting director Olivier Letang announced that the club would not stand in [ Sirigus ] way if he wished to leave Paris . However , the players agent denied that the player would leave the club . Sirigu remained PSGs first choice goalkeeper in the Coupe de France and Coupe de la Ligue , winning both titles , with Trapp taking his place as the preferred choice in Ligue 1 and UEFA Champions League matches . On 12 February 2016 , he announced that he would have left PSG during the previous winter transfer window if an important proposal had arrived , but ultimately remained with the club for the remainder of the season . Loans to Sevilla and Osasuna . On 26 August 2016 , Sirigu joined La Liga club Sevilla FC on a season-long loan . He made his debut with the club in a 1–1 away draw against Eibar on 17 September .

Having made only three appearances for the Andalusians , Sirigu moved to fellow league club , strugglers CA Osasuna on 31 January 2017 for the remainder of the season . Torino . On 27 June 2017 , Torino announced they had signed Sirigu on a free transfer . He made his debut for Torino on 12 August , in a 7–1 home win against Trapani in the Coppa Italia third round , and eight days later made a first Serie A appearance in a 1–1 draw away to Bologna .

On 28 February 2010 , he received his first call-up for the Italian national team by manager Marcello Lippi for a friendly game versus Cameroon to be played at Stade Louis II , Monaco , but did not play , as Federico Marchetti was chosen to start . In May , he was included in Lippis 28-man provisional 2010 FIFA World Cup squad , but was not included in the 23-man final squad for the tournament . Upon Cesare Prandelli taking the helm as national coach , Sirigu was named in his first squad list for the friendly against Ivory Coast . He made his international debut in that game losing 1–0 , on 10 August 2010 . On 3 September , on his second cap , he played his first competitive match , a 2–1 away win against Estonia for Euro 2012 qualifying .

In the final tournament , he once again did not feature as Italy finished in third place . Sirigu was selected by Prandelli as his second-choice goalkeeper for the 2014 FIFA World Cup . However , prior to the tournament , the usual starter and captain Buffon received an ankle injury during training and Sirigu played the opening group game against England in Manaus on 14 June . He made several decisive saves which contributed to the 2–1 Italian victory . Buffon returned to the first team for the remaining two group games against Costa Rica and Uruguay , both of which Italy lost 1–0 , and as a result , Italy were eliminated in the first round of the tournament . On 31 May 2016 , Sirigu was included in Antonio Contes 23-man Italy squad for UEFA Euro 2016 . Due to a bout of fever suffered by starting keeper Buffon , Sirigu made his only appearance of the tournament on 22 June , in his nations final group match , a 1–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland . Italy were eliminated from the tournament in the quarter-finals , following a penalty shoot-out loss against Germany . Style of play . Regarded as one of the best Italian goalkeepers of his generation , Sirigu was considered in the 2010s as the possible heir-apparent of Gianluigi Buffon as Italys first-choice goalkeeper , due to his consistency , physical strength , composure , strong mentality , explosive reflexes , and shot-stopping ability between the posts . Although he was frequently compared to Zenga in his youth , his former manager at Cremonese , Emiliano Mondonico , compared him to Dino Zoff because of his calm character under pressure . Former Italy goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi has also praised Sirigu for his goalkeeping technique and ability to come off his line quickly to collect the ball . Personal life .

The First Air Group was the collective name given to the attack wings who would jointly carry out heavier attacks in the event of war . It was active in various formations from 1938 to 1995 . It was directly subordinate to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces and therefore nicknamed ÖB:s klubba ( Supreme Commanders club ) . Naming . Since its foundation in 1926 the Swedish Air Force grouped its aircraft into Flygkår ( Air Corps , like the Första flygkåren , Andra flygkåren , Tredje flygkåren - the First , the Second , the Third Air Corps etc. ) , this being the aviation equivalent of an army regiment . In 1936 the Swedish Air Force switched from army-like to navy-like naming of its flying units . Thus the air corps became flying flotillas ( flygflottiljer , sing . flygflottilj ) with the respective geographic region added as an official name , thus the Second Air Corps ( Andra Flygkår ) established in 1926 became the Second Royal Roslagen Flying Flotilla ( Andra Kungliga Roslagens Flygflottilj ) in 1936 . Following the naval nomenclature these flying flotillas were further divided into divisions ( divisioner , sing . division ) like the navys destroyer divisions . In the end of 1938 the Swedish Air Force formed an air squadron ( Flygeskadern ) in the end of 1938 . In 1942 it became the First Air Squadron ( E1 Första Flygeskadern ) , with the Second and Third to follow in 1943 and the Fourth in 1945 . So the traditional Swedish naming of air units is as follows : - Eskader or Flygeskader - USAF Air Division or RAF Air Group equivalent - Flottilj or Flygflottilj - USAF Air Wing or RAF Station equivalent - Division - Air Squadron - Grupp - Flight History . According to the Defence Act of 1936 , an air group commander would in case of war carry out the immediate command of the Swedish Air Force units that were part of the air group . In peacetime , his duties were to plan exercises , inspect wing exercises and conduct co-exercises and major practical exercises , that is , not to have constant command of Swedish Air Force wings . Flygeskadern ( the Air Group ) was organized in response to the emergency preparedness in September 1939 and was resolved ( except for the staff ) in the latter part of 1940 . According to the Defence Act of 1942 , four air groups would be permanently organized and in peacetime command the constituent wings regarding tactical and operational exercises . Its staff was located in Karlsborg from 1939 to 1942 . In 1942 the Swedish Air Force expanded its war organization into four air groups and the Air Group was renamed First Air Group ( Första flygeskadern , E 1 ) , with its staff in Stockholm . The distribution of the Swedish Air Force wings to the air groups varied from 1 July 1945 , when all four air groups had been organized . The First Air Group had attack duties , the Second and Third Air Group had fighter duties and the Fourth Air Group had reconnaissance duties . The staff were merged with the staff of the Western Airbase Area ( Västra flygbasområdet , Flybo V ) on 1 October 1957 and was placed in Gothenburg . This air group was meant to have attack duties . Its command center Björn , was located south of Skara . In 1966 the First Air Group became the only air group in the Swedish Air Force , when the three others were decommissioned . The commander of the First Air Group was subordinate to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces according to instruction by the King in Council . Issues concerning unit training and production , the commander of the First Air Group was subordinate to the Chief of the Air Force .

Founded on 22 August 1949 , it plays in Segunda División , holding home games at the Estadio Gran Canaria , with a capacity of 32,400 seats . The club remains the only one in Spanish football to achieve back-to-back promotions to La Liga in its first two seasons . It had a 19-year run in the competition , ending in 1982–83 . They have been promoted to La Liga on three additional occasions since that time ( a total of eight additional seasons ) , most recently from 2015 to 2018 . Its main rivals are Tenerife from said neighbouring island . Las Palmas and Tenerife contest the Canary Islands derby . The two clubs are among the most isolated professional football clubs in Europe , since they play their away games on the distant Spanish mainland . History . Foundation and early years . Even though the club registered with the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 6 June 1949 , UD Las Palmas was officially founded on 22 August of that year , as the result of a merger between all five clubs on the island : Club Deportivo Gran Canaria , Atlético Club de Fútbol , Real Club Victoria , Arenas Club and Marino Fútbol Club . The union was to create a club strong enough to keep Canarian players on the island and not to seek a better career on the mainland . Debate was held on the name of the club , which it was agreed would not include the names of any of its predecessors . An early option , Deportivo Canarias , was scrapped due to referring to the Canary Islands on a whole rather than the island of Gran Canaria . The name Las Palmas by itself was also put forward , and then rejected due to the name having already been taken by a defunct club in the city ; Unión Deportiva Las Palmas was finally chosen due to its connection to the union which created the team , and its home city of Las Palmas . The first training session at the new club was held on 16 September 1949 . Las Palmas finished second in their first season in the Tercera División ( 1949–50 ) , ranking third in the following years Segunda División to reach La Liga for the first time ever , and became the first Spanish club to achieve consecutive promotions in its first two years of existence . The first season in the top flight ended , however , in relegation , but the team returned to the category in 1954 , going on to enjoy a six-year spell . Top-flight success . After Las Palmas returned to La Liga at the end of the 1963–64 season , again as champions , the club went on to have their most successful spell in the competition . Managed by Vicente Dauder , they finished third in 1967–68 behind Real Madrid and FC Barcelona , and four club players made the Spain squad which hosted and won the UEFA Euro 1964 tournament ; the following season the team fared even better and only lost the league to Real Madrid , and thus qualified for European competition for the first time in its history , appearing in the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and being knocked out in the first round by Germanys Hertha BSC ( 0–0 home draw , 0–1 away loss ) . Las Palmas player Juan Guedes died suddenly on 9 March 1971 at the age of 28 . The next season , French coach Pierre Sinibaldi led the club to the fifth place , with subsequent qualification for the UEFA Cup : after disposing of Torino F.C . and ŠK Slovan Bratislava , the Spaniards bowed out to Dutch club FC Twente ; at the end of 1974–75 another team player , Tonono – a defender who played with Guedes – died of a liver infection . Las Palmas third appearance in European competition came with the 1977–78 UEFA Cup , where they defeated FK Sloboda Tuzla of Yugoslavia in the first round before falling to the English side Ipswich Town . Under the management of Miguel Muñoz , and with players such as Argentines Miguel Ángel Brindisi , Daniel Carnevali ( the first to arrive in 1973 ) , Carlos Morete and Quique Wolff , the club also reached their first final of the Copa del Rey in that year , losing on 19 April to Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium ( 1–3 ) . From the 1990s onwards , Las Palmas played mainly in the Segunda División , but also spent six years in Segunda División B – the new third level created in 1977 – and , from 2000 to 2002 , competed in the top flight . On 3 October 2001 the side managed a 4–2 home win against Real Madrid , with youth product Rubén Castro scoring two goals for the hosts , but the season ended nonetheless in relegation . On 22 December 2001 , Las Palmas played its 1,000th game in La Liga .

Or at least you dont notice it . She starred in Aloha Paradise , Bare Essence , and Crossings ( 1986 ) . She played the lead in a TV movie , Dark Crossings ( 1986 ) , replacing Loretta Young . She said , At my time in life , I dont want to do bit parts . Also , Rosalind Russell once said , Always escape the mother parts . And Ive avoided them . Fontaines last role for television was in the 1994 TV film Good King Wenceslas , after which she retired to her estate , Villa Fontana , in Carmel Highlands , California , where she spent time in her gardens and with her dogs . For her contribution to the motion picture industry , Fontaine has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1645 Vine Street . She left her hand and foot prints in front of the Graumans Chinese Theatre on 26 May 1942 . She was a practicing Episcopalian and a member of Episcopal Actors Guild . Personal life . Fontaine held dual citizenship ; she was British by birthright ( both her parents were British ) and became an American citizen in April 1943 . Outside of acting , Fontaine was also noted as being a licensed pilot , an accomplished interior decorator , and a Cordon Bleu-level chef . Marriages and children . Fontaine was married and divorced four times . Her first marriage was to actor Brian Aherne , in 1939 in Del Monte , California ; they divorced in April 1945 . In May 1946 , she married actor/producer William Dozier in Mexico City . They had a daughter , Deborah Leslie , in 1948 , and separated in 1949 . Deborah is Fontaines only biological child . The following year , Fontaine filed for divorce , charging Dozier with desertion . Their divorce was final in January 1951 . The two of them had a custody battle over their child which lingered through the 1950s . Fontaines third marriage was to producer and writer Collier Young on November 12 , 1952 . They separated in May 1960 , and Fontaine filed for divorce in November 1960 . Their divorce was final in January 1961 . Fontaines fourth and final marriage was to Sports Illustrated golf editor Alfred Wright , Jr , on January 23 , 1964 , in Elkton , Maryland ; they divorced in 1969 . Fontaine also had a personal relationship with Adlai Stevenson : We had a tenderness for each other that grew into something rather serious . There was so much speculation about our marrying in the press that over lunch at his apartment in the Waldorf Towers he told me he could not marry an actress . He still had political ambitions and the little old ladies from Oshkosh wouldnt approve . I told him it was just as well . My family would hardly approve of my marrying a politician . While in South America for a film festival in 1951 , Fontaine met a four-year-old Peruvian girl named Martita , and informally adopted her . Fontaine met Martita while visiting Incan ruins where Martitas father worked as a caretaker . Martitas parents allowed Fontaine to become Martitas legal guardian to give the child a better life . Fontaine promised Martitas parents she would send the girl back to Peru to visit when she was 16 years old . When Martita turned 16 , Fontaine bought her a round-trip ticket to Peru , but Martita refused to go and opted to run away . Fontaine and Martita became estranged following the incident . While promoting her autobiography in 1978 , Fontaine addressed the issue , stating , Until my adopted daughter goes back to see her parents , shes not welcome . I promised her parents . I do not forgive somebody who makes me break my word . Sibling rivalry . Fontaine and her sister , Olivia deHavilland , are the only set of siblings to have won lead acting Academy Awards . Olivia was the first to become an actress ; when Fontaine tried to follow her lead , their mother , who favored Olivia , refused to let Joan use the family name . Subsequently , Fontaine had to invent a name , taking first Joan Burfield , and later Joan Fontaine taking her stepfathers surname . Biographer Charles Higham records that the sisters had an uneasy relationship from early childhood , when Olivia would rip up the clothes Joan had to wear as hand-me-downs , forcing Joan to sew them back together . A large part of the friction between the sisters stemmed from Fontaines belief that Olivia was their mothers favorite child . De Havilland and Fontaine were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1942 . Fontaine won for her role in Alfred Hitchcocks Suspicion over deHavillands performance in Hold Back the Dawn . Higham states that Fontaine felt guilty about winning given her lack of obsessive career drive ... . Higham has described the events of the awards ceremony , stating that as Fontaine stepped forward to collect her award , she pointedly rejected deHavillands attempts to congratulate her and that deHavilland was both offended and embarrassed by her behaviour . Fontaine , however , tells a different story in her autobiography , explaining that she was paralyzed with surprise when she won the Academy Award , and that deHavilland insisted that she got up to accept it . Olivia took the situation very graciously , Fontaine wrote . I was appalled that Id won over my sister . Several years later , however , deHavilland apparently remembered what she perceived as a slight and exacted her own revenge by brushing past Fontaine , who was waiting with her hand extended , because deHavilland took offense at a comment Fontaine had made about deHavillands husband . Contrary to press reports , the sisters continued their relationship after the 1940s . After Fontaines separation from her husband in 1952 , deHavilland went to her apartment in New York often , and at least once they spent Christmas together there , in 1961 . They were photographed laughing together at a party for Marlene Dietrich in 1967 . Fontaine also visited deHavilland in Paris in 1969 . The sisters reportedly did not completely stop speaking to each other until 1975 , after their mothers funeral , to which Joan , who was out of the country , was not invited . Both sisters largely refused to comment publicly about their relationship . In a 1978 interview , however , Fontaine said of the sibling rivalry , I married first , won the Oscar before Olivia did , and if I die first , shell undoubtedly be livid because I beat her to it ! The following year , in a 1979 interview , Fontaine claimed the reason her sister and she stopped speaking to each other was that deHavilland wanted their mother ( who was suffering from cancer ) to be treated surgically at the advanced age of 88 , which Fontaine apparently did not think was a good idea . Fontaine claims that after their mother died , deHavilland did not bother to try to find where Fontaine could be reached ( Fontaine was on tour in a play ) . Instead , deHavilland sent a telegram , which did not arrive until two weeks later at Fontaines next stop . According to Fontaine , deHavilland did not invite her to a memorial service for their mother . DeHavilland claims she informed Fontaine , but Fontaine brushed her off , claiming she was too busy to attend . Higham records that Fontaine had an estranged relationship with her own daughters , as well , possibly because she discovered that they were secretly maintaining a relationship with deHavilland . Death . On December 15 , 2013 , Fontaine died in her sleep of natural causes at the age of 96 in her Carmel Highlands home . Her longtime friend Noel Beutel said , She had been fading in recent days and died peacefully . After Fontaines death , deHavilland released a statement saying she was shocked and saddened by the news . Fontaines Academy Award for Best Actress in Suspicion was initially to be sold at an animal rights auction ; however , the Academy threatened to sue since it was not offered back to them for $1 and Fontaines estate retained possession .

Fontaine received her first major role in The Man Who Found Himself ( 1937 ) and in 1939 with Gunga Din . Her career prospects improved greatly after her starring role in Alfred Hitchcocks Rebecca ( 1940 ) , for which she received her first of three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress . The following year , she won that award for her role in Hitchcocks Suspicion ( 1941 ) . A third nomination came with The Constant Nymph ( 1943 ) . She appeared mostly in drama films through the 1940s , including Letter from an Unknown Woman ( 1948 ) , which is now considered a classic . In the next decade , after her role in Ivanhoe ( 1952 ) , her film career began to decline and she moved into stage , radio and television roles . She appeared in fewer films in the 1960s , which included Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea ( 1960 ) , and her final film role in The Witches ( 1966 ) . Edward Small borrowed her to play Louis Haywards love interest in The Duke of West Point ( 1938 ) , then Stevens used her at RKO in Gunga Din ( 1939 ) as Douglas Fairbanks Jr.s love interest . The film was a huge hit , but Fontaines part was relatively small . Republic borrowed her to support Dix in Man of Conquest ( 1939 ) but her part was small . George Cukor gave her a small role in MGMs The Women ( 1939 ) . Selznick wanted to cast her in Ill Be Seeing You ( 1944 ) but she refused , saying she was sick of playing the sad sack . Selznick suspended her for eight months . Eventually she went back to work in The Affairs of Susan ( 1945 ) for Hal Wallis at Paramount , her first comedy . She returned to RKO for From This Day Forward ( 1946 ) . Fontaine was married and divorced four times . Her first marriage was to actor Brian Aherne , in 1939 in Del Monte , California ; they divorced in April 1945 .</p><p>pred_time: </p><p>groundtruth: Brian Aherne</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-184"/wiki/Barry_Marshall#P108#3</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Barry_Marshall#P108#3<p>context: Barry Marshall Barry James Marshall ( born 30 September 1951 ) is an Australian physician , Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or Medicine , Professor of Clinical Microbiology and Co-Director of the Marshall Centre at the University of Western Australia . Marshall and Robin Warren showed that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) plays a major role in causing many peptic ulcers , challenging decades of medical doctrine holding that ulcers were caused primarily by stress , spicy foods , and too much acid . This discovery has allowed for a breakthrough in understanding a causative link between Helicobacter pylori infection and stomach cancer . Education and early life . Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie , Western Australia and lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of eight . His father held various jobs , and his mother was a nurse . He is the eldest of four siblings . He attended Newman College for his secondary education and the University of Western Australia School of Medicine , where he received a Bachelor of Medicine , Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS ) in 1974 . He married his wife Adrienne in 1972 and has four children . Career and research . In 1979 , Marshall was appointed as a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital . He met Robin Warren , a pathologist interested in gastritis , during internal medicine fellowship training at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981 . Together , the pair studied the presence of spiral bacteria in association with gastritis . In 1982 , they performed the initial culture of H . pylori and developed their hypothesis related to the bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer . It has been claimed that the H . pylori theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors , who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach . Marshall was quoted as saying in 1998 that everyone was against me , but I knew I was right . On the other hand , it has also been argued that medical researchers showed a proper degree of scientific scepticism until the H . pylori hypothesis could be supported by evidence . In 1982 Marshall and Warren obtained funding for one year of research . The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis . However , it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days . This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days . Due to other hospital work , the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day , and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday . In this sample , they discovered the presence of H . pylori . It turns out that H . pylori grow more slowly than 2 days , and also that the stomach cultures are not contaminated by other organisms . In 1983 they submitted their findings so far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia , but the reviewers turned their paper down , rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received in 1983 . After failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984 , Marshall , after having a baseline endoscopy done , drank a broth containing cultured H . pylori , expecting to develop , perhaps years later , an ulcer . He was surprised when , only three days later , he developed vague nausea and halitosis ( due to the achlorhydria , there was no acid to kill bacteria in the stomach , and their waste products manifested as bad breath ) , noticed only by his mother . On days 5–8 , he developed achlorhydric ( no acid ) vomiting . On day eight , he had a repeat endoscopy , which showed massive inflammation ( gastritis ) , and a biopsy from which H . pylori was cultured , showing it had colonised his stomach . On the fourteenth day after ingestion , a third endoscopy was done , and Marshall began to take antibiotics . Marshall did not develop antibodies to H . pylori , suggesting that innate immunity can sometimes eradicate acute H . pylori infection . Marshalls illness and recovery , based on a culture of organisms extracted from a patient , fulfilled Kochs postulates for H . pylori and gastritis , but not for peptic ulcer . This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal . After his work at Fremantle Hospital , Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital ( 1985–86 ) and at the University of Virginia , USA ( 1986–present ) , before returning to Australia while remaining on the faculty of the University of Virginia . He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia ( UWA ) from 1998–2003 . Marshall continues research related to H . pylori and runs the H . pylori Research Laboratory at UWA . In 2007 , Marshall was appointed Co-Director of The Marshall Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Training , founded in his honour . In addition to Helicobacter pylori research , the Centre conducted varied research into infectious disease identification and surveillance , diagnostics and drug design , and transformative discovery . His research group expanded to embrace new technologies including next generation sequencing , and genomic analysis . In 2007 , Marshall also accepted a part-time appointment at the Pennsylvania State University . In August 2020 Barry Marshall , along with Simon J . Thorpe , accepted a position at the scientific advisory board of Brainchip INC , a computer chip company . Awards and honours . In 2005 , the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Marshall and Robin Warren , his long-time collaborator , for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease . Marshall also received the Warren Alpert Prize in 1994 ; the Australian Medical Association Award and the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1995 ; the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1996 ; the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1997 ; the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement , the Dr A.H . Heineken Prize for Medicine , the Florey Medal , and the Buchanan Medal of the Royal Society in 1998 . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ( FRS ) in 1999 . His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads : Barry Marshall , together with Robin Warren , discovered spiral bacteria in the stomachs of almost all patients with active chronic gastritis , or duodenal or gastric ulcers , and proposed that the bacteria were an important factor in the aetiology of these diseases . In 1985 , Marshall showed by self-administration that this bacterium , now called Helicobacter pylori , causes acute gastritis and suggested that chronic colonisation directly leads to peptic ulceration . These results were a major challenge to the prevailing view that gastric disorders had a physiological basis , rather than being infectious diseases . Marshall showed that antibiotic and bismuth salt regimens that killed H . pylori resulted in the cure of duodenal ulcers . The view that gastric disorders are infectious diseases is now firmly established and there is increasing evidence for a role of H . pylori infection in gastric cancers . The work of Marshall has produced one of the most radical and important changes in medical perception in the last 50 years . Barry Marshall was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Science in 1995 and the Buchanan Medal in 1998 . Marshall was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Life Sciences in 1999 ; the Keio Medical Science Prize in 2002 ; and the Australian Centenary Medal and Macfarlane Burnet Medal and Lecture in 2003 . Marshall was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007 . He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of Oxford in 2009 . Marshall was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences ( FAHMS ) in 2015 . Marshall was awarded the honour of Western Australian of the Year in 2006 .

He played in National Soccer League ( NSL ) for Heidelberg United and Morwell Falcons before moving to Perth Glory where he played eight seasons in the NSL and two in the A-League . Early life . Despotovski was born in Perth , Western Australia , to a Macedonian father , Cvetko , and mother , Valentina ( Saharov ) . Her maternal parents , Martin and Margareta Saharov were from Sevastopol , Crimea , USSR . Valentina was born in Kačarevo , Pančevo and married Cvetko in Vojvodina . Only nine months after his birth his family moved to Yugoslavia because his mother was homesick . He grew up with his family in the town of Pančevo , 16 km outside the capital Belgrade , and played junior level football with Red Star Belgrade . When Despotovski was 15 he had a choice to continue either handball which he says had always played a large part in his life , or to pursue a career in professional football , eventually he chose football and was selected to play for the reserve team at his first senior club , Dinamo Pančevo . Playing career . After a stint with the Yugoslav Peoples Army during the Yugoslav wars which ended as a result of self-inflicted injuries , Despotovski returned to his birthplace in 1992 and continued his professional career with Floreat Athena in the Western Australian Premier League . In 1994 , he joined Heidelberg in the NSL and left the club to join the now defunct NSL club Morwell Falcons in 1995 . Bobbys career took off when he received a call from the then Perth Glory general manager , Roger Lefort . The new club wanted Despotovski to lead their attack in the clubs inaugural season and he certainly didnt disappoint scoring 14 goals in only 23 NSL games . Despotovski was in the centre of a controversy when playing against the Melbourne Knights ( a team primarily supported by Croatian Australians ) at the Knights Stadium on 21 May 2001 he gave a three fingered salute to the predominantly Croatian crowd which is a Serbian Orthodox symbol that represents Orthodox Christianity . As the Perth team left the stadium Despotovski and Perth coach Bernd Stange were assaulted by angry Knights supporters . To avoid repetition of violence , the next Knights home fixture against Perth was played in Launceston . He was one of the most successful strikers in the now defunct Australian National Soccer League . Despotovski was with the Western Australian team Perth Glory for 10 years , and holds their all-time goal scoring record . Following the conclusion of the 2004/2005 season of the NSL Despotovski signed with Perth Glory for the 2005/2006 A-League season after a brief stint with the Bonnyrigg White Eagles in the Vodafone Premier League in NSW . Despotovski finished the season as joint top goal scorer of the league and winner of the Johnny Warren Medal . Season 2006/2007 started without Bobby because of his re-occurring back injury but he returned to partner Stuart Young up front . Coaching career . He was the coach of Inglewood United in 2007 , and the coach of Perth boys school Hale Schools 1st XI Soccer side in 2008 . He was variously the coach of the Perth Glory NPL U20s team and the Perth Glorys Womens team between 2015 and 2020 .

President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Labor Secretary on , and he was confirmed by the U.S . Senate on . A member of the Republican Party , he was appointed by President George W . Bush to the National Labor Relations Board , and later served as the assistant attorney general for civil rights and the U.S . attorney for the Southern District of Florida . He is a former dean of Florida International University College of Law . In 2007–2008 , as U.S . attorney , Acosta approved a plea deal that allowed child-trafficking ring-leader Jeffrey Epstein to plead guilty to a single state charge of solicitation , in exchange for a federal non-prosecution agreement . After Epsteins arrest in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges , Acosta faced renewed and harsher criticism for his role in the 2008 non-prosecution agreement , as well as calls for his resignation ; he resigned on July 19 and was replaced by Eugene Scalia . Background . Acosta is the only son of Cuban refugees . He is a native of Miami , Florida , where he attended the Gulliver Schools . Acosta received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Harvard College in 1990 , and received a Juris Doctor degree cum laude from Harvard Law School 1994 . He is the first member of his family to graduate from college . Early career . Following law school , Acosta served as a law clerk to Samuel Alito , then a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , from 1994 to 1995 . Acosta then worked at the office of the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis in Washington , D.C. , where he specialized in employment and labor issues . While in Washington , Acosta taught classes on employment law , disability-based discrimination law , and civil rights law at the George Mason University School of Law . On December 31 , 2013 , Acosta became the new chairman of U.S . Century Bank , the largest domestically owned Hispanic community bank in Florida and one of the 15 largest Hispanic community banks in the nation . During his tenure as chairman , U.S . Century Bank had its first year-end profit since the start of the Great Recession . Acosta was a member of the Board of Trustees of Gulliver Schools , where he served a past term as board chairman . George W . Bush administration . Acosta served in four presidentially appointed , U.S . Senate-confirmed positions in the George W . Bush administration . From December 2001 to December 2002 , he served as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S . Department of Justice . From December 2002 to August 2003 , he was a member of the National Labor Relations Board for which he participated in or authored more than 125 opinions . Then , he became Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division on August 22 , 2003 , where he was known for increasing federal prosecutions against human trafficking . Acosta authorized federal intervention in an Oklahoma religious liberties case to help assure the right to wear hijab in public school , and worked with Mississippi authorities to reopen the investigation of the 1955 death of Emmett Till , a 14-year-old black youth whose abduction and killing helped spark the civil rights movement . He was the first Hispanic to serve as Assistant Attorney General . While leading the Civil Rights division , Acosta allowed his predecessor , Bradley Schlozman , to continue to make decisions on hiring . A report by the inspector general and the Office of Professional Responsibility later found that Schlozman illegally gave preferential treatment to conservatives and made false statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee . Those findings were relayed to the office of the United States attorney for the District of Columbia , but Schlozman was not prosecuted . While it put the primary responsibility on Schlozman , the report also concluded that Acosta did not sufficiently supervise Schlozman and that in light of indications [ he and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sheldon Bradshaw ] had about Schlozmans conduct and judgment , they failed to ensure that Schlozmans hiring and personnel decisions were based on proper considerations . U.S . attorney for Southern District of Florida . In 2005 , Acosta was appointed as the U.S . attorney for Southern District of Florida , where his office successfully prosecuted the lobbyist Jack Abramoff , the terrorism suspect José Padilla , the founders of the Cali Cartel , and Charles McArther Emmanuel , the son of Liberias former leader . The district also targeted white collar crime , prosecuting several bank-related cases , including one against Swiss bank UBS . The case resulted in UBS paying $780 million in fines , and for the first time in history , the bank provided the United States with the names of individuals who were using secret Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S . federal income taxes . Other notable cases during his tenure include the corruption prosecution of Palm Beach County Commission chairman Tony Masilotti , Palm Beach County commissioner Warren Newell , Palm Beach County commissioner Mary McCarty , and Broward sheriff Ken Jenne ; the conviction of Cali Cartel founders Miguel and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela , for the importation of 200,000 kilos of cocaine , which resulted in a $2.1 billion forfeiture ; and the white-collar crime prosecutions of executives connected to Hamilton Bank . Acosta also emphasized health care fraud prosecutions . Under Acostas leadership the district prosecuted more than 700 individuals , responsible for a total of more than $2 billion in Medicare fraud . Jeffrey Epstein case . In 2008 , U.S . attorney Acosta approved a federal non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein . That secret agreement , conducted without consulting the victims , was later ruled illegal by a federal judge for violating the Crime Victims Rights Act . Background . Epstein , ostensibly a wealthy hedge fund manager , was known to have a number of highly influential connections , including British Royal Prince Andrew , Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz , former U.S . president Bill Clinton , at the time , future president Donald Trump , Tom Barrack , Leon Black , and Wilbur Ross , among others . In March 2005 , the Palm Beach Police Department received reports that Epstein had been engaged in sexually-inappropriate behavior with a minor . Police began a 13-month undercover investigation of Epstein , including a search of his home . The police search of Epsteins home found two hidden cameras and large numbers of photos of girls throughout the house , some of whom the police had interviewed in the course of their investigation . Details from the investigation included allegations that 12-year-old triplets were flown in from France for Epsteins birthday , to be sexually abused by the financier . After the Palm Beach Chief of Police requested assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , agents identified at least 34 confirmed minors whose allegations of sexual abuse by Epstein included corroborating details . The FBI investigation resulted in a 53-page indictment in June 2007 . Non-prosecution agreement . Acosta , then the U.S . Attorney for the Southern District of Florida , agreed to a plea deal , to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges to Epstein , along with four named co-conspirators and any unnamed potential co-conspirators . That agreement essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epsteins sex crimes . At the time , this halted the investigation and sealed the indictment . The Miami Herald reported : Acosta agreed , despite a federal law to the contrary , that the deal would be kept from the victims . The plea deal was later described as a sweetheart deal . Epstein would go on to serve only 13 months in a private wing of the county jail , permitted to leave for 12 hours a day as work release . Acosta has variously stated that he was not directly involved in the unusual agreement , that prosecutors determined it to be the best available solution , and that he was unduly pressured by Epsteins heavy-hitting lawyers . He also has argued the prosecution team believed conviction by trial in federal court was unlikely , and an agreement would therefore be the best way to put an end to Epsteins exploitation of underage girls . According to the Herald , Acosta took the unusual step of meeting with Epsteins attorney at a hotel 70 miles from the U.S . Attorneys office in Miami , and it was Acosta who finalized the agreement . According to the article : In email after email , Acosta.. . acquiesced to Epsteins legal teams demands , which often focused on ways to limit the scandal by shutting out his victims and the media , including suggesting that the charges be filed in Miami , instead of Palm Beach , where Epsteins victims lived . Acosta later said he offered a lenient plea deal because he was told that Epstein belonged to intelligence , was above his pay grade , and to leave it alone . Responses . The federal agreement and Epsteins subsequent lenient treatment while incarcerated by the State of Florida have been the subject of criticism , with the Miami Herald calling the agreement the deal of a lifetime . The fact that the agreement with Epstein also protected unnamed potential co-conspirators from federal prosecution drew speculation that perhaps the deal was intended to protect influential people in Epsteins orbit . However , others have described that clause as intended to protect those of Epsteins victims who had been enticed to help him recruit other victims for abuse . A federal judge later found that the prosecutors had violated the victims rights in that they had concealed the agreement from the victims and instead urged them to have patience . The federal agreement with Epstein was not a typical criminal law plea bargain , but instead employed a structure commonly used in regulatory settlements with corporations . In an op-ed , the approach was described by a member of the prosecution team as a method to address the state of Floridas prior decision not to bring felony charges against Epstein for the same activities . Jeffrey Sloman , one of the prosecutors in the case , defended the agreement in a February 2019 op-ed piece in the Miami Herald : Our priorities were to make sure Epstein could not hurt anyone else and to compensate Epsteins victims without retraumatizing them . Our team worked diligently to build a federal case against Epstein . Throughout the investigation , we took care to be respectful of the pain Epsteins victims had endured . As we continued , however , it became clear that most of Epsteins victims were terrified to cooperate against him . Some hired lawyers to avoid appearing before a grand jury . One of the key witnesses moved to Australia and refused to return calls from us . We also researched and discussed significant legal impediments to prosecuting [ in federal court ] what was , at heart , a local sex abuse case . Given the obstacles we faced in fashioning a robust federal prosecution , we decided to negotiate a resolution.. . You can disagree with the result we reached , but our whole team — from Alex [ Acosta ] on down the chain of command — always acted with integrity and in good faith . Renewed interest . In 2017 , Acosta was nominated for Secretary of Labor . His handling of the Epstein case was discussed as part of his confirmation hearing . On November 28 , 2018 , as rumors circulated that Acosta was being considered as a possible successor to Attorney General Jeff Sessions , the Miami Herald published an investigation detailing Acostas role in the Epstein case . That story revealed the extent of collaboration between federal prosecutors and Epsteins attorneys in their efforts to keep victims from learning of the plea deal . The Herald describes an email from Epsteins attorney after his off-site meeting with Acosta : Thank you for the commitment you made to me during our Oct . 12 meeting , Lefkowitz wrote in a letter to Acosta after their breakfast meeting in West Palm Beach . He added that he was hopeful that Acosta would abide by a promise to keep the deal confidential . You .. . assured me that your office would not .. . contact any of the identified individuals , potential witnesses or potential civil claimants and the respective counsel in this matter , Lefkowitz wrote . The Herald article contended that certain aspects of Acostas non-prosecution agreement violated federal law . As part of the arrangement , Acosta agreed , despite a federal law to the contrary , that the deal would be kept from the victims . As a result , the non-prosecution agreement was sealed until after it was approved by the judge , thereby averting any chance that the girls — or anyone else — might show up in court and try to derail it . Victims , former prosecutors , and the retired Palm Beach police chief were among those quoted criticizing the agreement and Acostas role in it . Victims rights violation . After a lawsuit was filed in federal court , in 2019 , a court ruled that the non-prosecution agreement was invalid and that prosecutors had violated the victims rights with their non-prosecution agreement . On February 21 , 2019 , a ruling in federal court returned Acostas role in the Epstein case to the headlines . The decision to keep the deal with Epstein secret until after it was finalized was found to be a violation of the Crime Victims Rights Act of 2004 ( CVRA ) , which requires notifying victims of the progress of federal criminal cases . The CVRA was new and relatively untested at the time of the Epstein non-prosecution agreement . In 2008 , representatives for two of Epsteins victims filed a lawsuit in federal court aiming to vacate the federal non-prosecution agreement on the grounds that it violated the CVRA . For more than a decade , the U.S . Attorneys office denied that it acted in violation of victims rights laws and argued that the CVRA did not apply in the Epstein case . The governments contention that the CVRA did not apply was based on questions of timing ( whether or not CVRA applied prior to filing of federal charges ) , relevance ( whether the CVRA applied to non-prosecution agreements ) , and jurisdiction ( whether the case should be considered a federal case or a state case under the CVRA ) . The court rejected those arguments in the February 21 , 2019 ruling , finding that the CVRA did in fact apply and that victims should have been notified of the Epstein non-prosecution agreement in advance of its signing , to afford them the opportunity to influence its terms . At the conclusion of his ruling , the federal judge in the case noted that he was not ruling that the decision not to prosecute was improper , but was simply ruling that , under the facts of this case , there was a violation of the victims rights [ for reasonable , accurate , and timely notice ] under the CVRA . Because the CVRA does not specify penalties for failure to meet victims notification requirements , the judge offered both parties opportunities to suggest remedies—Epsteins victims who were party to the suit asked for rescission of the federal non-prosecution agreement with Epstein , while the government suggested other approaches , maintaining that other victims were against rescinding the agreement due to privacy concerns and possible impacts to restitution paid under the agreement . Following the Herald investigation and related news coverage , members of Congress submitted a formal request to the U.S . Department of Justice for review of Acostas role in the Epstein deal , and several editorials called for Acostas resignation or termination from his then-current position as U.S . Labor Secretary . In February 2019 , the Justice Departments Office of Professional Responsibility notified Senator Ben Sasse that it had opened an investigation into Epsteins prosecution . Epsteins arrest and Acostas resignation . On July 6 , 2019 , Epstein was arrested by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force on sex trafficking charges stemming from activities alleged to have occurred in 2002–2005 . The search of his townhouse turned up evidence of sex trafficking and also found hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs of fully – or partially – nude females . Some of the photos were confirmed as those of underage females . In a locked safe , compact discs were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions : Young [ Name ] + [ Name ] , Misc nudes 1 , and Girl pics nude . Amid criticism of his mishandling of the Epstein case , Acosta resigned his role as Secretary of Labor effective July 19 , 2019 . Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10 , 2019 . According to an internal review conducted by the Department of Justices Office of Professional Responsibility , which was released in November 2020 , Acosta showed poor judgment in granting Epstein a non-prosecution agreement and failing to notify Epsteins alleged victims about this agreement . Law school dean . On July 1 , 2009 , Acosta became the second dean of Florida International University College of Law . He spearheaded the effort to establish the Master of Studies in Law in banking compliance , Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering at FIU Law . Secretary of Labor . Nomination and confirmation . President Donald Trump announced in a press conference on February 16 , 2017 , that he would nominate Acosta to fill the position of Secretary of Labor after the nomination of Andrew Puzder was withdrawn . Acosta was recommended by White House counsel Don McGahn . Acosta is the first , and – – the only Hispanic person to serve in Trumps cabinet . The Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions held confirmation hearings on March 22 , 2017 , and Acostas nomination was reported out of the committee on March 30 , 2017 . On April 27 , 2017 , Acosta was confirmed as Secretary of Labor by the U.S . Senate in a 60–38 vote . He received the support of eight Democratic Senators and all Republican senators except Senator Pat Toomey , who did not participate in the vote . On April 28 , 2017 , Acosta was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence . Tenure . In 2019 , Acosta proposed cutting the funding of his departments International Labor Affairs Bureau from $68 million in 2018 to under $20 million in 2020 . That agency combats human trafficking ( including child sex trafficking ) , child labor and forced labor internationally . During Acostas confirmation hearing , he discussed the need and his support of apprenticeship as a workforce development tool to close the skills gap . On June 15 , 2017 , President Trump signed Executive Order 13801 , Presidential Executive Order Expanding Apprenticeships in America , establishing the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion with Acosta serving as the chair . The task force held five public meetings and issued their final report to President Trump on May 10 , 2018 . Following the task force final report , the U.S . Department of Labor announced the following initiatives to expand and promote apprenticeship opportunities : - Create a new industry-recognized apprenticeship program system to complement the registered apprenticeship system . - Launch Apprenticeship.gov as a one-stop source for all things apprenticeship . Acosta announced that the Trump administration maintained a goal of one million new apprentices . Acosta resigned as Labor Secretary , effective July 19 , 2019 , following criticism of his role in the Epstein case . Recognition .

In March 2005 , the Palm Beach Police Department received reports that Epstein had been engaged in sexually-inappropriate behavior with a minor . Police began a 13-month undercover investigation of Epstein , including a search of his home . The police search of Epsteins home found two hidden cameras and large numbers of photos of girls throughout the house , some of whom the police had interviewed in the course of their investigation .

In 1998 , Papakonstantinou returned to Greece and was appointed an adviser to then-Prime Minister Costas Simitis on information society issues . Two years later , he was appointed Special Secretary for the Information Society at the Ministry of Economy and Finance ( 2000–2002 ) . Between 2002 and 2004 he served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors of the Ministry of Economy and Finance , as a board member of OTE ( Hellenic Telecommunication Organization ) , and as the Greek representative to the European Unions Economic Policy Committee ( EPC ) .

He was also a board member of the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies , PASOKs think tank , from 2005 to 2008 . Between 2003 and 2007 , Papakonstantinou also taught economics at Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business and advised the European Commission on research and information society issues , participating in various international research projects .

In September 2007 , he was elected member of the Hellenic Parliament to represent the district of Kozani , and was subsequently appointed PASOKs Press Spokesman in March 2008 . Papakonstantinou headed PASOKs list of candidates for the European Parliament in the 2009 European elections and was elected MEP in June 2009 . In October 2009 he was appointed Finance Minister in the government formed by Papandreou , the former prime minister , after the national elections . As Finance Minister , he revealed that the Greek deficit was much larger than what was reported by the previous government , and when Greece was shut out of international markets , he negotiated a €110bn loan agreement for Greece with the EU and the International Monetary Fund , together with a programme of severe fiscal consolidation and structural reforms . During his tenure , he overhauled the budget process , instituting a medium-term fiscal framework with expenditure monitoring and assessment mechanisms , and an independent statistical authority ; embarked on tax reform , with legislative and organizational changes to combat tax evasion ; implemented a wide-ranging program of structural reforms in product , service and financial markets ; and designed a large-scale and wide-ranging privatization strategy . When he left office , the public deficit was more than 6 percentage points of GDP lower than upon his appointment , while Greece had recovered half the competitiveness lost since Eurozone entry and was named the OECD country with the fastest pace of structural reforms . In June 2011 , Prime Minister George Papandreou reshuffled the government and appointed him Minister of Environment , Energy and Climate Change , a post he kept in the government of Lucas Papademos until he handed over to a caretaker Minister in May 2012 .

While Papakonstantinou asked the Greek tax authorities to investigate the list , they failed to do so . In late 2012 , prosecutors asked for a fresh copy of the Greek list and compared it to the one they had , they found that three names were missing from the list , all relatives of Papakonstantinou . Those allegations resulted in his expulsion from the PASOK political party . He has consistently denied all charges and claims he is being made a scapegoat for the inaction of others on this issue as well as for the publics need to punish politicians for the austerity policies in Greece . In 2015 , a Special Court convened for this case and composed of 13 judges drawn from the two highest Greek courts unanimously cleared him of the breach of faith charge , concluding that there had been no damage to the State from his actions . At the same time , with an 8 to 5 majority by the court , he received a suspended misdemeanour conviction for the tampering charge .

Two years later , he was appointed Special Secretary for the Information Society at the Ministry of Economy and Finance ( 2000–2002 ) .

He was also a board member of the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies , PASOKs think tank , from 2005 to 2008 . Between 2003 and 2007 , Papakonstantinou also taught economics at Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business and advised the European Commission on research and information society issues , participating in various international research projects . Political career . In May 2005 , Papakonstantinou was elected a member of the National Council of PASOK . In September 2007 , he was elected member of the Hellenic Parliament to represent the district of Kozani , and was subsequently appointed PASOKs Press Spokesman in March 2008 . Papakonstantinou headed PASOKs list of candidates for the European Parliament in the 2009 European elections and was elected MEP in June 2009 . In October 2009 he was appointed Finance Minister in the government formed by Papandreou , the former prime minister , after the national elections . As Finance Minister , he revealed that the Greek deficit was much larger than what was reported by the previous government , and when Greece was shut out of international markets , he negotiated a €110bn loan agreement for Greece with the EU and the International Monetary Fund , together with a programme of severe fiscal consolidation and structural reforms . During his tenure , he overhauled the budget process , instituting a medium-term fiscal framework with expenditure monitoring and assessment mechanisms , and an independent statistical authority ; embarked on tax reform , with legislative and organizational changes to combat tax evasion ; implemented a wide-ranging program of structural reforms in product , service and financial markets ; and designed a large-scale and wide-ranging privatization strategy . When he left office , the public deficit was more than 6 percentage points of GDP lower than upon his appointment , while Greece had recovered half the competitiveness lost since Eurozone entry and was named the OECD country with the fastest pace of structural reforms . In June 2011 , Prime Minister George Papandreou reshuffled the government and appointed him Minister of Environment , Energy and Climate Change , a post he kept in the government of Lucas Papademos until he handed over to a caretaker Minister in May 2012 . In the field of environment , he accelerated the closure of uncontrolled landfills ; revamped the waste management and recycling systems ; helped implement a large number of water management projects co-funded by EU Structural Funds ; advanced the completion of land and urban planning and of the national cadastre . In energy , he brought legislation to liberalize the energy market ; oversaw a large increase of Greeces renewable energy capacity and presented a road map for energy policies to 2050 ; spearheaded ambitious renewable energy projects , such as Project Helios for exporting solar energy ; pursued Greek participation in international gas routes ; and brought forward the exploration of Greeces hydrocarbon potential . He was one of a number of Papademos cabinet who failed to be re-elected in the May 6 , 2012 General election that saw PASOK lose almost 120 seats in the house . Following the elections , Papakonstantinou has faced a parliamentary investigation into the handling of the so-called Lagarde list , containing information on the deposits of roughly 2,000 Greek citizens at HSBC banks Geneva branch , which he asked for and received from French authorities in 2010 . While Papakonstantinou asked the Greek tax authorities to investigate the list , they failed to do so . In late 2012 , prosecutors asked for a fresh copy of the Greek list and compared it to the one they had , they found that three names were missing from the list , all relatives of Papakonstantinou . Those allegations resulted in his expulsion from the PASOK political party . He has consistently denied all charges and claims he is being made a scapegoat for the inaction of others on this issue as well as for the publics need to punish politicians for the austerity policies in Greece . In 2015 , a Special Court convened for this case and composed of 13 judges drawn from the two highest Greek courts unanimously cleared him of the breach of faith charge , concluding that there had been no damage to the State from his actions . At the same time , with an 8 to 5 majority by the court , he received a suspended misdemeanour conviction for the tampering charge . In 2016 he published a book in which he told his story as finance minister of Greece when the debt crisis unfolded . Personal life . Papakonstantinou is married to travel writer . They have two sons , Nicolas and Stefanos .

In addition to her numerous scholarly publications , she wrote poetry , fiction , theatre pieces , screenplays , and an autobiography . She served as president of the Organization of American Historians from 1980 to 1981 . In 1980 , she was appointed Robinson Edwards Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , where she taught until retiring in 1991 . Lerner was one of the founders of the academic field of womens history . In 1963 , while still an undergraduate at the New School for Social Research , she taught Great Women in American History , which is considered to be the first regular college course on womens history offered anywhere . She taught at Long Island University from 1965 to 1967 . She played a key role in the development of womens history curricula and was involved in the development of degree programs in womens history at Sarah Lawrence College ( where she taught from 1968 to 1979 and established the nations first masters degree program in womens history ) and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , where she launched the first Ph.D . program in womens history . She also worked at Duke University and Columbia University , where she was a co-founder of the Seminar on Women . Early life . She was born Gerda Hedwig Kronstein in Vienna , Austria on April 30 , 1920 , the first child of Ilona Kronstein ( née Neumann , 1897 , Budapest1948 , Zürich ) and Robert Kronstein ( 1888 , Vienna1952 , Vaduz ) , an affluent Jewish couple . Her family are originating and relating to Breslau , Berlin , ( , ) , ( Turdos , , ) ( Upper Hungary ) , Helishoy ( , ) ( Moravia ) , and Reichenberg ( ) ( Bohemia ) . Her father was a pharmacist , and her mother an artist , with whom Gerda , according to her autobiography , had a strained relationship as a child . As an adult , Gerda believed that her mother Ilona struggled because she did not fit in the role of a Viennese wife and mother . Gerda had a younger sister , and they attended local schools and gymnasium . Following the 1938 Anschluss , Kronstein became involved with the anti-Nazi resistance . She and her mother were jailed that year after her father had escaped to Liechtenstein and Switzerland , where he stayed during the war . Gerda Kronstein occupied a cell for six weeks with two Christian women held on political grounds . They shared their prison food with her because Jews received restricted rations . In 1939 , her mother moved to France , and Lerners sister relocated to Palestine . That year , Gerda immigrated to the United States under the sponsorship of the family of Bobby Jensen , her socialist fiancé . Career . Settling in New York , Kronstein married Jensen . She worked in a variety of jobs as a waitress , salesperson , office clerk , and X-ray technician , while also writing fiction and poetry . She published two short stories featuring first-person accounts of the Nazi annexation of Austria . Her marriage with Jensen was failing when she met Carl Lerner ( 1912–1973 ) , a married theater director who was a member of the Communist Party USA . They both established temporary residence in Nevada and obtained divorces in Reno ; the state offered easier terms for divorce than did most others . Kronstein and Lerner married and moved to Hollywood , where Carl pursued a career in film-making . In 1946 , Gerda Lerner helped found the Los Angeles chapter of the Congress of American Women , a Communist front organization . The Lerners engaged in CPUSA activities involving trade unionism , civil rights , and anti-militarism . They suffered under the rise of McCarthyism in the 1950s , especially the Hollywood blacklist . The Lerners returned to New York . In 1951 , Gerda Lerner collaborated with poet Eve Merriam on a musical , The Singing of Women . Lerners novel No Farewell was published in 1955 . Lerner returned to New York to study at the New School for Social Research , where she received a bachelors degree in 1963 . She has said that her frequent status made her think about people who did not have a voice in telling their own stories . Lerners insights eventually influenced her decision to earn a Ph.D . in history and then to help establish womens history as a standard academic discipline . In 1963 , she offered the first regular college course in womens history , which at the time had no status as a field of study in academia . In the early 1960s , Lerner and her husband coauthored the screenplay of the film Black Like Me ( 1964 ) , based on the book by white journalist John Howard Griffin . He had reported on six weeks of travel in small towns and cities of the Deep South passing as a black man . Carl Lerner directed the film , starring James Whitmore . Lerner continued with graduate studies at Columbia University , where she earned both the M.A . ( 1965 ) and Ph.D . ( 1966 ) . Her doctoral dissertation was published as The Grimke Sisters from South Carolina : Rebels Against Slavery ( 1967 ) , a study of Sarah Moore Grimké and Angelina Grimké , sisters from a slaveholding family who became abolitionists in the North . Learning that their late brother had mixed-race sons , they helped pay to educate the boys . In 1966 , Lerner became a founding member of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) , and she served as a local and national leader for a short period . In 1968 , she received her first academic appointment at Sarah Lawrence College . There Lerner developed a Master of Arts Program in Womens History , which Sarah Lawrence offered beginning in 1972 ; it was the first American graduate degree in the field . Lerner also taught at Long Island University in Brooklyn . In the 1960s and 1970s , Lerner published scholarly books and articles that helped establish womens history as a recognized field of study . Her 1969 article The Lady and the Mill Girl : Changes in the Status of Women in the Age of Jackson , published in the journal American Studies , was an early and influential example of class analysis in womens history . She was among the first to bring a consciously feminist lens to the study of history . Among her most important works are the documentary anthologies Black Women in White America ( 1972 ) and The Female Experience ( 1976 ) , which she edited , along with her essay collection , The Majority Finds Its Past ( 1979 ) . In 1979 , Lerner chaired The Womens History Institute , a fifteen-day conference ( July 13–29 ) at Sarah Lawrence College , co-sponsored by the college , the Womens Action Alliance , and the Smithsonian Institution . It was attended by leaders of national organizations for women and girls . When the Institute participants learned about the success of the Womens History Week celebrated in Sonoma County , California , they decided to initiate similar commemorations within their own organizations , communities , and school districts . They also agreed to support an effort to secure a National Womens History Week . This helped lead to the national establishment of Womens History Month . In 1980 , Lerner moved to the University of Wisconsin at Madison , where she established the nations first Ph.D . program in womens history . At this institution , she wrote The Creation of Patriarchy ( 1986 ) , The Creation of Feminist Consciousness ( 1993 ) , parts one and two of Women and History ; Why History Matters ( 1997 ) , and Fireweed : A Political Autobiography ( 2002 ) . From 1981 to 1982 , Lerner served as president of the Organization of American Historians . As an educational director for the organization , she helped make womens history accessible to leaders of womens organizations and high school teachers . Selected works . Lerner edited ( 1972 ) , which chronicles 350 years of black womens contributions to history , despite centuries of being enslaved and treated as property . It was one of the first books to detail the contributions of black women in history . In The Creation of Patriarchy ( 1986 ) , volume one of Women and History , Lerner ventured into prehistory , attempting to trace the roots of patriarchal dominance . She concluded that patriarchy was part of archaic states forming in the 2nd millennium BCE . Lerner provides historical , archeological , literary , and artistic evidence for the idea that patriarchy is a cultural construct . She believed that the main strength of patriarchy was ideological and that in western societies it severed the connection between women and the Divine . ( 1993 ) is her second volume of Women and History . In this book , she reviews European culture from the seventh century through the nineteenth centuries , showing the limitations imposed by a male-dominated culture . After the seventh century , more of womens writings began to survive , and Lerner uses these to show the development of what she defines as feminist thought . She demonstrates the numerous ways that women have bypassed or redefined or undermined male thought . She examines in detail the educational deprivation of women , their isolation from many of the traditions of their societies , and the expressive outlet many women have found through writing . Often beginning in religious or prophetic writing , this was a way for women to engage in what Lerner calls ideological production , including defining alternative futures and think themselves out of patriarchy . ( 2003 ) is a detailed account of Lerners life from her childhood in Vienna through war and emigration , to 1958 . That year , she began her formal studies at the New School for Social Research in New York , an institution established by numerous European refugees from the Nazi persecution . She believed that education and life work were critical to womens self-realization and happiness .

He played for the United States mens national soccer team at the 1930 FIFA World Cup , and scored the second goal in World Cup history against Belgium . He was inducted into the U.S . National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1986 . Youth . McGhee was the son of former Hibernian player and Heart of Midlothian manager James McGhee , and the brother of Philadelphia Field Club forward Jimmy McGhee . McGhees father was a renowned Scottish player who appeared with Scotland in an 1886 game with Wales . McGhees father had a controversial term as the manager of Hearts . When he finally resigned on December 6 , 1909 , he began assessing his options . In September 1910 he decided to leave Scotland and emigrate to the United States . It took Jimmy McGhee two years to get settled and it was not until 1912 that McGhee , his mother and younger brother Jimmy joined his father in the U.S . When they arrived in the U.S. , the family settled in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . Playing . Amateur . When he was nineteen , McGhee began playing for New York Shipbuilding , located in Camden , New Jersey , of the South Jersey League . The next season , he moved to Wolfenden Shore , of the Allied American Football Association ; playing with them until at least March 1921 when he was on trial with Bethlehem Steel F.C . before moving to Philadelphia Hibernian of the National Soccer League of Philadelphia . He played with them from 1921 to 1922 . Professional . In 1922 , McGhee signed with the New York Field Club of the American Soccer League . He spent two seasons with New York before moving to Fleisher Yarn in 1924 . Fleisher had existed for years as an amateur powerhouse , but in 1924 the team went professional . It was unable to maintain itself as a professional team and folded at the end of the season . When Fleisher failed , McGhee moved to Indiana Flooring which played in New York City . McGhee spent two seasons with Indiana . In 1927 , Charles Stoneham , owner of the New York Giants baseball team , bought Indiana Flooring . He renamed the team the New York Nationals . To make matters even more confusing , Stoneham renamed the team again , in 1932 . That year the original New York Giants ASL club folded . Stoneham acquired the rights to the name and used it for his club . McGhee played with this team , under all its names , through 1932 , except for a loan period to Philadelphia Field Club during the 1928–1929 season . In 1928 , the New York Nationals won the National Challenge Cup . In 1929 , the club then won the Lewis Cup , the ASL cup competition . Under the new name , New York Giants , the club also won the 1930–1931 ASL championship . After 1929 ASL statistics become patchy as the Great Depression and the ASL/FIFA Soccer Wars took a toll on the league . Despite this , McGhee played at least 350 games and scored 137 goals from 1921–1931 . According to the National Soccer Hall of Fame , There are also reports in some publications that he later played in England for Hull City . However , he [ sic ] son Ed , who lives in Riverton , New Jersey , told me that , apart from his trip to South America , Bart never left the U.S . National team . McGhee earned three caps with the U.S . national team , all coming in the 1930 FIFA World Cup . He scored the first goal for a U.S . team in World Cup competition in the opening victory over Belgium , which became the 2nd goal in the history of World Cups . In 1986 , the National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted McGhee . During his ASL career Bart McGhee played in 350 league games and scored 127 goals , almost all of them from the left wing position .

He represented Scotland once , in 2010 . Bell joined Rangers in 2013 , helping them to the Scottish League One title in his first season . He played for Dundee United during the 2016–17 season , saving three penalty kicks in one match against Dunfermline . He then had short spells with Kilmarnock , Hibernian , Partick Thistle , St .

Bell was born in Dumfries and was on the books of local club Queen of the South as a youngster and was also part of the youth set up at Annan Athletic . Bell moved from Queens to Kilmarnock in 2002 . In 2006 , he extended his contract with Kilmarnock although he had not yet appeared for the first team . In the 2006–07 season Bell had a spell on loan at Montrose , getting a taste of first team football . Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies said in November 2007 that he was prepared to allow Bell to go out on loan once he had fully recovered from a cruciate injury . Bell recalled how this injury affected his career , saying that the club doctor at Kilmarnock believed he might never play again . In July 2008 , Bell was loaned out by Kilmarnock to his home town club Queen of the South , having been in the Queens squad as a trialist for their two previous pre-season matches .

At the end the season , he signed a new one-year contract with the club . After signing the new deal , Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies hinted that Bell faced a battle in order to become the clubs first choice goalkeeper . Bell played in the first two games of the 2009–10 season for Kilmarnock in place of injured first choice goalkeeper Alan Combe . Mark Brown was then brought in on loan from Celtic to cover for Combe , but when he returned to his parent club in January 2010 , Bell then became the established first choice goalkeeper for Kilmarnock . On 2 February 2010 , Bell played as Kilmarnock beat Celtic 1–0 . After the match , newly appointed Kilmarnock manager Jimmy Calderwood praised Bell , describing his performance as fabulous .

Bell remained first pick for the start of the 2010–11 season , with his performances attracting attention from Scotland manager Craig Levein . In November 2010 , manager Mixu Paatelainen said he had started negotiating a new contract for Bell and said he believed Bell should stay and remain as a first choice goalkeeper , rather than move on , believing his career would greatly decline , having been linked with Aberdeen and Rangers .

In May 2011 , with Paatelainen having left Kilmarnock , Bell said he made amend with the club and was ready to sign a new deal .

He said his decision to sign wasnt a financial one , having rejected clubs in South Africa , Denmark and England . Bell played the first ten games of the season , before suffering an elbow injury in mid-October . While sidelined , Bell went to a specialist to have injections to end his injury .

Lowrie was born on April 17 , 1984 , in Salem , Oregon , and later attended North Salem High School . In 2004 , while playing for the Stanford University Cardinal baseball team , Lowrie earned Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Year honors . He was a First Team All-American in 2004 and 2005 . At Stanford , future major league outfielders Sam Fuld , John Mayberry Jr. , and Carlos Quentin were among Lowries teammates . Professional career . Boston Red Sox . From 2005 through 2007 , Lowrie played for Boston at three different minor league levels . During the 2007 season , he made the Eastern League All-Star team , was named the Portland Sea Dogs Most Valuable Player , and the Red Sox Minor League Offensive Player of the Year . He was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League late in the season .

He made his debut on April 15 , driving home three runs in a 5–3 victory in Cleveland . Lowrie was called up to replace Julio Lugo when he went on the DL . On August 1 , 2008 , in teammate Jason Bays first game on the Red Sox , Lowrie hit a game winning infield single in the 12th inning to knock in Bay with the decisive run and upend the Oakland Athletics , 2–1 . Lowrie was responsible for the other Red Sox run in that game , as a sacrifice fly in the second inning allowed Bay to score from third . On August 24 , he hit his second home run of the season , a game-winner , as the Sox won 6–5 . He committed no errors in 49 games played at shortstop during the regular season , and played regularly in the 2008 postseason as one of Bostons two starting shortstops . Lowrie hit his first major league home run against the Twins inside the Metrodome . On October 6 , 2008 , Lowrie drove in the series-winning run against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim .

During the 2009 regular season , Lowrie appeared in five games for Boston before landing on the 15-day disabled list with a left wrist sprain on April 13 ( retroactive to April 12 ) . On April 21 , the switch-hitter underwent an ulnar styloid excision and arthroscopic ligament repair on his left wrist performed by Dr . Donald Sheridan which landed him on the 60-day disabled list . Lowrie began a minor league rehab assignment on June 21 and on July 8 the Red Sox activated him from the 60-day DL . Lowrie came off the DL July 18 . However , on August 8 , he was placed on the disabled list again with ulnar neuritis in his left wrist . On September 8 , he was re-activated from the DL when the Red Sox expanded their 40-man roster . In his first game back against the Blue Jays in Toronto he hit a home run batting right-handed . On October 4 , he hit his first career grand slam against the Cleveland Indians . During spring training , Lowrie suffered from mononucleosis , and as a result , he missed the start of the season . He made his season debut on July 21 , 2010 against the Oakland Athletics . On August 21 , 2010 , he hit a walk-off home run against the Toronto Blue Jays in the 11th inning off of Casey Janssen .

He filed for $1.5 million , but the Astros countered with $900,000 . Had Lowrie gone to a hearing , he would not have had bonuses in his contract . Oakland Athletics . The Astros on February 4 , 2013 traded Lowrie and Fernando Rodriguez to the Oakland Athletics for Chris Carter , Brad Peacock , and Max Stassi . The trade reunited him with former Red Sox teammate Josh Reddick . Lowrie was initially expected to play second base , but due to the struggles and injury of shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima , Lowrie was placed at shortstop , and was the regular starter there throughout the 2013 season . Lowrie continued as Oaklands starting shortstop during the 2014 season . On August 4 , Lowrie broke his right index finger while fielding a ground ball—after attempting to play through the injury , Lowrie went to the disabled list on August 15 . He was hitting a career-low .238 with five home runs . Second stint with Astros . The Astros announced on December 15 , 2014 , that they had agreed to a three-year contract with Lowrie . There was a club option for a fourth year . The deal was worth as much as $28 million . Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow said that Lowrie fit well with one of the main objectives for the 2015 Astros , which was to improve the defensive skills of the teams infield . Some teams had explored signing Lowrie to play second base or third base . The Astros had a need at his preferred position , shortstop , though minor league prospect and shortstop Carlos Correa has a chance to make the major league team at some point during the 2015 season . Astros leadership has said that Correa will stay at shortstop ; Astros beat writer Evan Drellich predicted that Lowrie might move to third base if Correa were called up to the major leagues . Second stint with Athletics . On November 25 , 2015 , Lowrie was traded back to the Athletics for minor league pitcher Brendan McCurry . After the As acquired shortstop Marcus Semien in a trade with the White Sox , Lowrie moved to second base . His 2015 season was cut short due to numerous injuries , allowing him to play in 69 games only . His 2016 season would be cut short due to injury as well , as he was diagnosed with a season ending toe injury , ending his season short to 87 games . In 2017 , Lowrie set a new Oakland record for most doubles in a season , with 49 . On July 10 , 2018 , owning a .288 batting average with 16 home runs and 62 RBI , Lowrie was named as an All-Star for the first time in his career , replacing injured Gleyber Torres on the team .

He has served in two legislatures in the United Kingdom and served as Minister for Culture and Sport in the Scottish Executive Cabinet . Watson was expelled from his party on 22 September 2005 following his conviction and imprisonment for fire-raising at Prestonfield House , but was re-admitted to the Labour Party in July 2012 . He currently sits as a Labour member of the House of Lords and is an Associate Director of the Edinburgh public affairs and communications company Caledonia Consulting . On 18 September 2015 , the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appointed Watson as Education spokesman in the House of Lords . Early life . Watson was born in Cambuslang , South Lanarkshire , but his family moved to Invergowrie , Perth and Kinross when he was very young . He was educated at Invergowrie Primary School , the High School of Dundee and Heriot-Watt University , Edinburgh , graduating with a B.A . Hons in Economics and Industrial Relations in 1974 . Prior to entering politics Watson worked as a tutor/organiser for the Workers Educational Association and in the trade union movement , for the Association of Scientific , Technical and Managerial Staffs ( ASTMS ) and the Manufacturing , Science and Finance union ( MSF ) . Political career . Watson was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Glasgow Central at a by-election in 1989 , following the death of Bob McTaggart MP . He was re-elected in the 1992 election and represented that constituency until it was abolished in 1997 . He sought the nomination from the Labour party to run for the Govan seat at the 1997 election , but after initially winning the nomination by one vote , he lost a re-run to Mohammad Sarwar . On 6 November 1997 , he was created a Life peerage as Baron Watson of Invergowrie , of Invergowrie in Perth and Kinross . In 1999 Lord Watson was elected as the Member of the Scottish Parliament ( MSP ) for the Glasgow Cathcart constituency and was re-elected in 2003 . On 20 July 1999 Watson announced his intention to introduce the Protection of Wild Mammals bill as a members bill to the Scottish Parliament to outlaw fox hunting . The bill passed a vote 83–36 on 13 February 2002 and received Royal Assent on 15 March , becoming the Protection of Wild Mammals ( Scotland ) Act 2002 and becoming law on 1 August . This was a precursor to the Hunting Act 2004 banning fox hunting in England and Wales . When Jack McConnell became First Minister in 2001 , Watson entered the Scottish Executive as Minister for Tourism , Culture and Sport . He left the Executive in 2003 , having lost his position in a reshuffle after the 2003 election . He subsequently became deputy convener of the enterprise and culture committee . On 15 November 2004 , Watson was charged with wilful fire raising , and the Labour whip was withdrawn from him in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments . On 1 September 2005 he admitted the offence and resigned from the Scottish Parliament . Watson was also expelled from the Labour Party when the sentence was announced . After serving a prison sentence he was released in May 2006 . In January 2007 Watson was appointed as an Associate Director with Caledonia Consulting , while also attending the House of Lords on a regular basis . Watson was re-admitted to membership of the Labour Party in July 2012 , after a vote of the National Executive Committee . In September 2015 , Jeremy Corbyn appointed Watson as the Labour spokesman on education in the Lords . Fire-raising conviction . On 15 November 2004 , Lord Watson was charged with two counts of wilful fire raising after a private reception at Edinburghs Prestonfield Hotel following the Scottish Politician of the Year awards on 11 November . The first alleged that he set fire to a curtain in the hotels reception , and the second that he set fire to a curtain in the hotels Yellow Room . On being charged , the Labour whip was suspended in the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments . After initially registering not guilty pleas to both charges on 23 August 2005 , he changed his plea on 1 September to guilty on the first count , and had a not guilty plea accepted on the second charge . On the same day that Lord Watson admitted his guilt , he resigned from the Scottish Parliament . He resigned as a director of Dundee United Football Club . It was not possible for a life peer to resign from the House of Lords at that time and there was no provision for peers convicted of criminal offences to be stripped of their titles . Such legislation was last proposed following the conviction of Jeffrey Archer for perjury in 2001 , but rejected . The House of Lords Reform Act 2014 made resignation possible . On 22 September 2005 , Lord Watson was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment . Sheriff Kathrine Mackie justified the sentence , stating that there was both a significant risk of re-offending and that Lord Watson offered no explanation . She also told Lord Watson that consumption of alcohol neither excuses nor fully explains your behaviour . The sentence was reduced from 20 months to 16 because Watson had pleaded guilty before the case reached trial . Watson appealed against his sentence on 23 March 2006 but the appeal judges refused to cut the term , and he was returned to prison . After serving half of his sentence ( eight months ) , he was released on 23 May 2006 . Views on Jeremy Corbyn . In an interview with The House magazine in March 2017 , Lord Watson was asked whether Labour could win a UK general election under Jeremy Corbyn . He said : Probably not . There are trends there that suggest were not getting through and the result in Copeland certainly suggested that , so it will be difficult to turn that around . But we shouldnt underestimate the extent to which the government can get into difficulties over the European Union exit negotiations . Its not going to be anything approaching plain sailing for them . Bibliography . - Watson , Mike ( 1985 ) . Rags to Riches : The official history of Dundee United .

They were the first new narrow gauge locomotives ordered by the railroad since 1903 . They initially comprised class E-4-148-S , but were reclassified K-28 in 1924 when the railroad reorganized into the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad . Design . The chassis is of outside-frame design with the drive wheels placed between the two main frames and the steam cylinders and running gear ( cranks , counterweights , rods and valve gear ) to the outside . This general arrangement was also used on the earlier class K-27 and later class K-36 and K-37 engines . Operations . Among other duties , they were tasked with hauling the express passenger trains over the D&amp;RGWs narrow gauge lines , such as the San Juan from Alamosa to Durango , the Shavano from Salida to Gunnison and The Silverton from Durango to Silverton . The K-28s also operated on the Chili Line from Antonito to Santa Fe until that route was closed in 1941 . White Pass &amp; Yukon . During World War II , seven members of the class were purchased by the US Army for use on the White Pass and Yukon Route in Alaska and the Yukon where they were renumbered USA 250 to USA 256 . But they did not fare well in the bitter Yukon winters . In particular , the unusual , extended counterweights on the driving wheel axles made them liable to ride up on trackside ice , and as a result , lifting the engine off the rails . All seven were withdrawn from service in 1944 and were barged to Seattle in 1946 for scrapping . The K-28s today . The three locos which remained with the D&amp;RGW , numbers 473 , 476 and 478 , were assigned to the Durango – Silverton tourist trains from the 1950s onwards . The Durango &amp; Silverton inherited these when it took over the Silverton Branch in 1981 . As of February 13 , 2018 , all three locomotives are operational . However , as of February 2020 , number 473 is currently undergoing conversion from burning coal to burning oil and number 478 is currently awaiting a future overhaul . Due to their smaller size , these engines are often used by the Durango &amp; Silverton for shorter trains , usually the first or last on the schedule , and also for helper service or sectioned trains . Despite being slightly smaller , a little older and less powerful than the K-36s , the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing . Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard , as the clamshell-style firedoors tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft , and if any flues in the boiler are leaking , the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives . Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large heel pattern , generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible , and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors . This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet , which usually is hindered by the lack of draft between the grates and the arch brick . New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this because there are fewer training hours available on the K-28 class locomotives compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving of poor technique . These locomotives are popular subjects for model railroaders and high quality scale models in HOn3 and On3 scales have been produced by several manufacturers since the 1950s . Variants .

He is known for his distinctive vocal quality , poetic lyrics and unique stage presence . Possessing a distinctive voice , Stipe has been noted for the mumbling style of his early career . Since the mid-1980s , Stipe sings in wailing , keening , arching vocal figures that R.E.M . biographer David Buckley compared to Celtic folk artists and Muslim muezzin . He was in charge of R.E.M.s visual aspect , often selecting album artwork and directing many of the bands music videos . Outside the music industry , he owns and runs two film production studios , C-00 and Single Cell Pictures . As a member of R.E.M. , Stipe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007 . As a singer-songwriter , Stipe influenced a wide range of artists , including Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Thom Yorke of Radiohead . Bono of U2 described his voice as extraordinary , and Yorke told The Guardian that Stipe is his favorite lyricist , saying I loved the way he would take an emotion and then take a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful . Early life and education . John Michael Stipe was born on January 4 , 1960 , in Decatur , Georgia , to Marianne and John Stipe . He was a military brat ; his father was a serviceman in the United States Army whose career resulted in frequent relocations for his family . His younger sister , Lynda Stipe , was born in 1962 and became the vocalist of her own band , Hetch Hetchy . Stipe and his family moved to various locales during his childhood , including West Germany , Texas , Illinois , and Alabama . In 1978 , he graduated from high school in Collinsville , Illinois . His senior photo is pictured in the album art work of Eponymous . Stipe also worked at the local Waffle House . He was raised in and came from a place of faith , as previous generations of his family were Methodist ministers . Career . R.E.M. . While attending the University of Georgia in Athens , Stipe frequented the Wuxtry record shop , where he met store clerk Peter Buck in 1980 . He was a striking-looking guy and he also bought weird records , which not everyone in the store did , Buck recalled . The two became friends ; they eventually decided to form a band and started writing music together , although at the time Stipe was also in a local group named Gangster . Buck and Stipe were soon joined by Bill Berry and Mike Mills , and named themselves R.E.M. , a name Stipe selected at random from a dictionary . Stipe was the youngest member of the band . All four members of R.E.M . dropped out of school in 1980 to focus on the new band . Stipe was the last to do so . The band issued its debut single , Radio Free Europe , on Hib-Tone ; it was a college radio success . The band signed to I.R.S . Records for the release of the Chronic Town EP one year later . In 1983 , R.E.M . released its debut album , Murmur , which was acclaimed by critics . Stipes vocals and lyrics received particular attention from listeners . Murmur went on to win the Rolling Stone Critics Poll Album of the Year over Michael Jacksons Thriller . Their second album , Reckoning , followed in 1984 . In 1985 , R.E.M . traveled to England to record their third album , Fables of the Reconstruction , a difficult process that brought the band to the verge of a break up . After the album was released , relationships in the band remained tense . Gaining weight and acting eccentrically ( such as by shaving his hair into a monks tonsure ) , Stipe later said of the period , I was well on my way to losing my mind . They toured in Canada and throughout Europe that year ; Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time . Projects . In September 1983 , a few months after the release of R.E.M.s debut album , Stipe participated in a low-budget , forty-five-minute Super-8 film called Just Like a Movie , shot in Athens by New York Rocker magazine photographer Laura Levine , who was a friend of the band . Those with acting roles in the film included Levine , Stipe , his sister Lynda , Matthew Sweet ( who formed a short-lived duo , Community Trolls , with Michael Stipe ) , and R.E.M.s Bill Berry . The film remains unreleased . Stipe had planned a collaboration with friend Kurt Cobain , lead singer of Nirvana , in 1994 , partly in an attempt to lure Cobain away from his home and his drug addiction . However , they did not manage to compose or record anything before Cobains death . Stipe was chosen as the godfather of Cobain and Courtney Loves daughter , Frances Bean Cobain . R.E.M . recorded the song Let Me In from the 1994 album Monster in tribute to Cobain . Stipe was once very close to fellow alternative rock singer Natalie Merchant and has recorded a few songs with her , including one titled Photograph , which appeared on a pro-choice benefit album titled Born to Choose , and they appeared live with Peter Gabriel singing Gabriels single Red Rain at the 1996 VH1 Honors and a few other times . Stipe and Tori Amos became friends in the mid-1990s and recorded a duet in 1994 called It Might Hurt a Bit for the Don Juan DeMarco motion picture soundtrack . Both Stipe and Amos decided not to release it . In 1998 , Stipe published a collection called Two Times Intro : On the Road with Patti Smith . In 2006 , Stipe released an EP that comprised six different cover versions of Joseph Arthurs In The Sun for the Hurricane Katrina disaster relief fund .

Later that year , he performed with Fischerspooner on the new song Have Fun Tonight from their 2018 album , Sir . Stipe released the solo song Future , If Future on March 24 , 2018 , followed by “Your Capricious Soul” on October 5 , 2019 . Drive to the Ocean was released for his 60th birthday on January 4 , 2020 . Photography has long been a passion for Stipe and he has been carrying a camera with him since his teenage years when he photographed shows featuring Ramones , The Runaways and Queen . In 2018 , Stipe released a book of his photography entitled Volume 1 , which featured 35 photographs of such celebrities as River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain . A second volume with Douglas Coupland , Our Interference Times : A Visual Record , was released in 2019 . In 2019 , Stipe collaborated with Aaron Dessner and Justin Vernon of Big Red Machine on the single No Time For Love Like Now . The song was finished and released in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic . Film and television work . In early 1987 , Stipe and Jim McKay co-founded C00 Films , a mixed-media company that was designed to channel its founders creative talents towards the creation and promotion of alternative film works . Stipe and his producing partner , Sandy Stern , have served as executive producers on films including Being John Malkovich , Velvet Goldmine and Man on the Moon . He was also credited as a producer of the 2004 film Saved ! In 1998 , he worked on Single Cell Pictures , a film production company that released several arthouse / indie movies . Stipe has made a number of acting appearances on film and on television . Stipe appeared in an episode of The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete as an ice cream man named Captain Scrummy . Stipe has appeared as himself with R.E.M . on Sesame Street , playing a reworked version of Shiny Happy People called Furry Happy Monsters , and appeared in an episode of The Simpsons titled Homer the Moe , in which R.E.M . was tricked into playing a show in Homer Simpsons garage . He also appeared as a guest on the Cartoon Network talk show spoof Space Ghost Coast to Coast in the episode Hungry . Stipe made several short appearances on The Colbert Report . Stipe voiced Schnitzel the Reindeer in the 1999 movie Olive , the Other Reindeer and appeared in the 1996 film Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day . Political activism . In March 2018 , Stipe joined the March for Our Lives rallies to advocate gun control after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting . He also released a teaser of his new song in the rally . Personal life . In 1983 , Stipe met fellow musician Natalie Merchant of the band 10,000 Maniacs ; the two started a friendship , and eventually had a romantic relationship for a period of time . With the success of the albums Out of Time ( 1991 ) and Automatic for the People ( 1992 ) , R.E.M . became mainstream music stars . Around 1992 , rumors that Stipe had contracted HIV began to circulate . He responded with In 1994 , with questions remaining , Stipe described himself as an equal opportunity lech , and said he did not define himself as gay , straight or bisexual , but that he was attracted to , and had relationships with , both men and women . In 1995 , he appeared on the cover of Out magazine . Stipe described himself as a queer artist in Time in 2001 and revealed that he had been in a relationship with an amazing man for three years at that point . Stipe reiterated this in a 2004 interview with Butt magazine . When asked if he ever declares himself as gay , Stipe stated , I dont . I think theres a line drawn between gay and queer , and for me , queer describes something thats more inclusive of the grey areas . In 1999 , author Douglas A . Martin published a novel , Outline of My Lover , in which the narrator has a six-year romantic relationship with the unnamed lead singer of a successful Athens , Georgia-based , rock band ; the book was widely speculated , and later confirmed by its author , to have been a roman à clef based on a real relationship between Martin and Stipe . The two had previously collaborated on two books , both in 1998 : The Haiku Year ( for which the two had both contributed haiku ) and Martins book of poetry Servicing the Salamander ( for which Stipe took the cover photograph ) . Musical style . Stipe possesses a baritone vocal range . His role in the songwriting process for R.E.M . was to write lyrics and devise melodies . While each member was given an equal vote in the songwriting process , Peter Buck has conceded that Stipe , as the bands lyricist , could rarely be persuaded to follow an idea he did not favor . Stipe sings in wailing , keening , arching vocal figures that R.E.M . biographer David Buckley compared to Celtic folk artists and Muslim muezzin . Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs ; in the chorus for Stand , Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics , creating a dialogue . Early articles about the band focused on Stipes singing style ( described as mumbling by The Washington Post ) , which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable . Stipe commented in 1984 , Its just the way I sing . If I tried to control it , it would be pretty false . That voice . Its an extraordinary voice , said U2s lead singer , Bono , in 2003 . I often tell him I think hes a crooner , and he doesnt like that very much . But it is sort of one part some sort of Bing Crosby 50s laid-back crooner , and one part Dolly Parton , he added , laughing . Stipe insisted that many of his early lyrics were nonsense , saying in a 1994 online chat , You all know there arent words , per se , to a lot of the early stuff . I cant even remember them . In truth , many early R.E.M . songs had definite lyrics that Stipe wrote with care . Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like simple pictures , but after a year he grew tired of the approach and started experimenting with lyrics that didnt make exact linear sense , and its just gone from there . In the mid-1980s , as Stipes pronunciation while singing became clearer , the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level . Mills explained , After youve made three records and youve written several songs and theyve gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say , are you saying anything ? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes.. . After what Stipe has referred to as The Dark Ages of American Politics [ The Reagan/Bush Years ] , R.E.M . incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green . Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were , and what we were surrounded by , which was just abject horror , Stipe said later . In 1987 and 88 there was nothing to do but be active . While Stipe continued to write songs with political subject matter like Ignoreland and Final Straw , later albums have focused on other topics . Automatic for the People dealt with mortality and dying . Pretty turgid stuff , according to Stipe ; Monster , meanwhile , critiqued love and mass culture , and Reveal dipped into mysticism .

In truth , many early R.E.M . songs had definite lyrics that Stipe wrote with care . Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like simple pictures , but after a year he grew tired of the approach and started experimenting with lyrics that didnt make exact linear sense , and its just gone from there . In the mid-1980s , as Stipes pronunciation while singing became clearer , the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level . Mills explained , After youve made three records and youve written several songs and theyve gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say , are you saying anything ? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes.. . After what Stipe has referred to as The Dark Ages of American Politics [ The Reagan/Bush Years ] , R.E.M . incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green . Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were , and what we were surrounded by , which was just abject horror , Stipe said later . In 1987 and 88 there was nothing to do but be active . While Stipe continued to write songs with political subject matter like Ignoreland and Final Straw , later albums have focused on other topics . Automatic for the People dealt with mortality and dying . Pretty turgid stuff , according to Stipe ; Monster , meanwhile , critiqued love and mass culture , and Reveal dipped into mysticism .</p><p>pred_time: </p><p>groundtruth: R.E.M</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-215"/wiki/Johannes_Teyssen#P108#1</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Johannes_Teyssen#P108#1<p>context: Johannes Teyssen Johannes Teyssen ( born 10 September 1959 ) is a German manager who has been the chairman and chief executive officer ( CEO ) of E.ON , a German multinational electric utility company , since 2020 .

Throughout his career , he has played for Bayern Munich , Newcastle United , Liverpool and Manchester City primarily in a defensive midfield position . He also spent time at Milton Keynes Dons as a player/coach before joining Leicester City as a first team coach . He was a member of the German national team from 1997 until 2006 and represented his nation in two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships , reaching the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final . He is known in Ireland as a football pundit on Raidió Teilifís Éireanns live coverage of major European and International competitions . Throughout his playing career Hamann gained a reputation for being a highly consistent and reliable player . He is highly respected by supporters of Liverpool due in large part to his involvement in the clubs victory in the 2005 Champions League final . On 5 July 2011 , Hamann was named as the new manager of Stockport County , replacing former manager Ray Mathias . He resigned from the post on 7 November 2011 after only four months with Stockport struggling in 17th place in the Conference Premier citing failure of a proposed takeover by Tony Evans . Club career . Early career . Hamann began his career at the little-known FC Wacker München . After impressing as a junior , he joined Bayern Munich as a 16-year-old in 1989 and debuted for the Bayern professional team in 1993 . Hamann joined a team led by Lothar Matthäus , Thomas Helmer , Christian Ziege and Oliver Kahn and played five games , mostly as a right winger . At first , Hamann was only a so-called Vertragsamateur ( i.e . an amateur player who had the licence for playing professional games ) . Still , he won his first German championship as a bench player . In the next season , Bayern suffered a major injury wave which claimed midfielders Matthäus , Swiss international Alain Sutter , talent Dieter Frey and veteran Markus Schupp , which allowed Hamann to become a regular ; he played 30 Bundesliga games and established himself as a valuable role player , playing either right wing or defensive midfield . He earned himself a full professional contract and was an important player in the tumultuous 1995–96 campaign , in which Bayern recruited striker Jürgen Klinsmann , coach Otto Rehhagel and midfielders Andreas Herzog , Thomas Strunz and Ciriaco Sforza , but the team was torn apart by heavy internal struggles . Although Hamann was overshadowed by these new midfield recruits , he played in 20 games and provided some stability for the infighting Bayern squad . Bayern ended a disappointing second and saw Rehhagel sacked , but ended the season by winning the UEFA Cup . The 1996–97 season was to become Hamanns breakthrough . After being a bench player most of his career until then , new coach Giovanni Trappatoni made him a starting defensive midfielder , and new recruit Mario Basler took the right wing . Hamann played in 23 games , also making his debut in the German national team and won his second German championship with Bayern . In private life , Hamann had to overcome a scary period when he broke down unconscious and was diagnosed with a stroke , but made a full recovery . The next season turned out rather disappointing for Bayern who trotted along after newly promoted 1 . FC Kaiserslautern for the vast majority of the season and finished second . Now an undisputed starter , Hamann played in 28 games and scored two goals . The season ended on a high for Bayern when they secured the DFB-Pokal against MSV Duisburg . Newcastle United . After playing for his country in the 1998 World Cup , he joined Newcastle United , managed at the time by Kenny Dalglish , for £5.5 million . Overcoming an early foot injury , Hamann played in 31 matches and scored five goals . In July 1999 he opted to join Gerard Houlliers Liverpool , who signed him for £8 million . Whilst at Newcastle he played in the 1999 FA Cup Final . Liverpool . Hamann established himself as an influential midfielder for Liverpool throughout his seven years at the club . All in all , Hamann played in 191 league games and scored eight goals . In the 2000–01 season , Hamann won his first big English trophy when Liverpool won a much-celebrated cup treble ( League Cup , FA Cup and UEFA Cup ) and a place in the Champions League . Hamann also played the full 90 minutes and assisted Liverpools second goal ( scored by Michael Owen ) in the teams 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the 2003 Worthington Cup final . Hamann established himself as a major first team player for Liverpool throughout his first few seasons there . Hamann played a major part in the 2005 Champions League Final win over A.C . Milan . Although he was suffering a broken toe during the final , Hamanns substitution for Steve Finnan at half time was the catalyst for Liverpools historic fightback . The team rallied after being 3–0 down to bring the game back to 3–3 and finally won in the penalty shootout ; Hamann also showed a great amount of composure and bravery , as he took and converted the first LFC penalty with his broken foot . This was not the only key part he played in their Champions league success . Earlier in the tournament , Hamann had been forced to stand in for Liverpools key player Steven Gerrard in the first leg of the last 16 round against Bayer Leverkusen . He excelled in the match and scored a late free-kick as Liverpool won the match 3–1 . Hamann won the FA Cup with Liverpool in May 2006 , coming on as a substitute in the second-half . He more than played his part in another trophy win for the Reds , who were 3–2 down to West Ham United at the time he came on . Steven Gerrard scored an injury-time leveller for Liverpool to take the match to extra-time . Liverpool would go on to win the Cup on penalties after a goalless extra-time . Once again , Hamann scored the first penalty in the shoot-out . Manchester City . In June 2006 , Hamann was given permission to talk to Bolton Wanderers about a potential transfer to the North West club . Hamann admitted that he would be saddened to leave Liverpool but would make the best decision for my future . Hamann actually signed a pre-contract in June 2006 , to become a Bolton Wanderers player but had a change of heart . He joined Bolton for less than one day before a move to Manchester City . On 12 July , he instead signed for Manchester City , with City agreeing to pay £400,000 compensation to Bolton . On 13 February , he signed a contract until the end of the 2008–09 season and scored his first goal for the club in a UEFA Cup qualifying first round match against EB/Streymur . However , on 28 August 2013 during Colin Murrays morning radio show with TalkSport Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside announced that the club had never officially signed the midfielder and that the necessary papers were just put in the draw . A Premier League investigation found that this wasnt the case and that Bolton had indeed signed Hamann , and expressed confusion as to why Gartside had lied about it . On 1 July 2009 , he was released by Manchester City as his contract expired . Hamann announced on 16 July that he intended to stay in England . On transfer deadline day in September 2009 , BBC Sport quoted Hamann as stating : Yes , Sven &lt;nowiki&gt; [ -Göran Eriksson ] &lt;/nowiki&gt; phoned me the other day to see if I wanted to sign for Notts County , but I said I wasnt interested at the moment as I feel I can still play at a higher level . There are a couple of things in Germany and Ill make my mind up by the end of the week . I have spoken to a couple of teams in England but that hasnt come to anything yet . Obviously , I can still sign after the deadline so maybe if teams dont get the players they want today then I will hear something . Milton Keynes Dons . On 20 May 2010 , Hamann signed a one-year contract as a player-coach at Milton Keynes Dons but only made 12 appearances as a player.When he left the club on 3 February 2011 to join Leicester City as a First Team Coach . he effectively retired from a playing career .

He signed a contract with the club on 7 March 2015 at the age of 41 . International career . Hamann played for Germany at under-21 level before making his full international debut in a friendly against South Africa in November 1997 . He was selected by manager Berti Vogts for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , being , at almost 25 , the second youngest player in an over-aged Germany squad . During the group stage , Hamann drifted in and out of the starting XI , finally breaking into the team when Germany gained momentum in the second round game against Mexico . However , after a quarter-final defeat against Croatia , Germany was out of the tournament . During the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying , Hamann established himself as a key player for a transitional Germany side . He played in all of Germanys games at the final tournament as they exited in the first round . Hamann was the last player to score at the old Wembley Stadium before its demolition when he scored the winning goal in Germanys qualifier for the 2002 World Cup against England in October 2000 . Alongside Michael Ballack and Bernd Schneider , Hamann was one of the key players in Germanys surprising run to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final . He became only the second Liverpool player after Roger Hunt in 1966 to play in a World Cup Final while still at the club , but finished on the losing side as Brazil won 2–0 in Yokohama . In the 67th minute of that match , Hamann lost the ball to opposing forward Ronaldo , who passed to Rivaldo , who shot from outside the area ; goalkeeper Oliver Kahn gave a rebound , allowing Ronaldo to score and give Brazil a 1–0 lead . The subsequent Euro 2004 turned out to be Hamanns last tournament . Again , the Euro ended with a disappointing first round exit for Germany . A 1–2 defeat against a Czech Republic side resting its key players proved to be Hamanns penultimate international game . After a strong performance in the 2005 Champions League final , Hamann was recalled for the Germany squad by new manager Jürgen Klinsmann . In the 2–2 draw against the Netherlands , Hamann produced a lacklustre performance , apparently convincing Klinsmann that he did not possess the required pace for that kind of level anymore . Hamann was dropped from the squad for the subsequent friendlies . Having not been selected for the German squad in the 2006 FIFA World Cup , he decided to officially retire from international football . Coaching and management career .

In his first league game in charge of Stockport , Hamanns side drew 1–1 with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn . The match was broadcast live on Premier Sports . Hamann resigned as Stockport County boss on 7 November 2011 , citing the failure of the proposed takeover by Tony Evans to materialise ; his team were languishing in 17th place having taken only three wins from his nineteen league games in charge . Broadcasting career . Hamann was enlisted by RTÉ Sport for their squad of pundits ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa . He returned to RTÉs team during UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil . More recently , in neighbouring Britain , Hamann has guested as a pundit on the BBCs Match of the Day 2 .

He was a member of the German national team from 1997 until 2006 and represented his nation in two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships , reaching the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final . He is known in Ireland as a football pundit on Raidió Teilifís Éireanns live coverage of major European and International competitions . Throughout his playing career Hamann gained a reputation for being a highly consistent and reliable player . He is highly respected by supporters of Liverpool due in large part to his involvement in the clubs victory in the 2005 Champions League final . On 5 July 2011 , Hamann was named as the new manager of Stockport County , replacing former manager Ray Mathias . He resigned from the post on 7 November 2011 after only four months with Stockport struggling in 17th place in the Conference Premier citing failure of a proposed takeover by Tony Evans . Club career . Early career . Hamann began his career at the little-known FC Wacker München . After impressing as a junior , he joined Bayern Munich as a 16-year-old in 1989 and debuted for the Bayern professional team in 1993 . Hamann joined a team led by Lothar Matthäus , Thomas Helmer , Christian Ziege and Oliver Kahn and played five games , mostly as a right winger . At first , Hamann was only a so-called Vertragsamateur ( i.e . an amateur player who had the licence for playing professional games ) . Still , he won his first German championship as a bench player . In the next season , Bayern suffered a major injury wave which claimed midfielders Matthäus , Swiss international Alain Sutter , talent Dieter Frey and veteran Markus Schupp , which allowed Hamann to become a regular ; he played 30 Bundesliga games and established himself as a valuable role player , playing either right wing or defensive midfield . He earned himself a full professional contract and was an important player in the tumultuous 1995–96 campaign , in which Bayern recruited striker Jürgen Klinsmann , coach Otto Rehhagel and midfielders Andreas Herzog , Thomas Strunz and Ciriaco Sforza , but the team was torn apart by heavy internal struggles . Although Hamann was overshadowed by these new midfield recruits , he played in 20 games and provided some stability for the infighting Bayern squad . Bayern ended a disappointing second and saw Rehhagel sacked , but ended the season by winning the UEFA Cup . The 1996–97 season was to become Hamanns breakthrough . After being a bench player most of his career until then , new coach Giovanni Trappatoni made him a starting defensive midfielder , and new recruit Mario Basler took the right wing . Hamann played in 23 games , also making his debut in the German national team and won his second German championship with Bayern . In private life , Hamann had to overcome a scary period when he broke down unconscious and was diagnosed with a stroke , but made a full recovery . The next season turned out rather disappointing for Bayern who trotted along after newly promoted 1 . FC Kaiserslautern for the vast majority of the season and finished second . Now an undisputed starter , Hamann played in 28 games and scored two goals . The season ended on a high for Bayern when they secured the DFB-Pokal against MSV Duisburg . Newcastle United . After playing for his country in the 1998 World Cup , he joined Newcastle United , managed at the time by Kenny Dalglish , for £5.5 million . Overcoming an early foot injury , Hamann played in 31 matches and scored five goals . In July 1999 he opted to join Gerard Houlliers Liverpool , who signed him for £8 million . Whilst at Newcastle he played in the 1999 FA Cup Final . Liverpool . Hamann established himself as an influential midfielder for Liverpool throughout his seven years at the club . All in all , Hamann played in 191 league games and scored eight goals . In the 2000–01 season , Hamann won his first big English trophy when Liverpool won a much-celebrated cup treble ( League Cup , FA Cup and UEFA Cup ) and a place in the Champions League . Hamann also played the full 90 minutes and assisted Liverpools second goal ( scored by Michael Owen ) in the teams 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the 2003 Worthington Cup final . Hamann established himself as a major first team player for Liverpool throughout his first few seasons there . Hamann played a major part in the 2005 Champions League Final win over A.C . Milan . Although he was suffering a broken toe during the final , Hamanns substitution for Steve Finnan at half time was the catalyst for Liverpools historic fightback . The team rallied after being 3–0 down to bring the game back to 3–3 and finally won in the penalty shootout ; Hamann also showed a great amount of composure and bravery , as he took and converted the first LFC penalty with his broken foot . This was not the only key part he played in their Champions league success . Earlier in the tournament , Hamann had been forced to stand in for Liverpools key player Steven Gerrard in the first leg of the last 16 round against Bayer Leverkusen . He excelled in the match and scored a late free-kick as Liverpool won the match 3–1 . Hamann won the FA Cup with Liverpool in May 2006 , coming on as a substitute in the second-half . He more than played his part in another trophy win for the Reds , who were 3–2 down to West Ham United at the time he came on . Steven Gerrard scored an injury-time leveller for Liverpool to take the match to extra-time . Liverpool would go on to win the Cup on penalties after a goalless extra-time . Once again , Hamann scored the first penalty in the shoot-out . Manchester City . In June 2006 , Hamann was given permission to talk to Bolton Wanderers about a potential transfer to the North West club . Hamann admitted that he would be saddened to leave Liverpool but would make the best decision for my future . Hamann actually signed a pre-contract in June 2006 , to become a Bolton Wanderers player but had a change of heart . He joined Bolton for less than one day before a move to Manchester City . On 12 July , he instead signed for Manchester City , with City agreeing to pay £400,000 compensation to Bolton . On 13 February , he signed a contract until the end of the 2008–09 season and scored his first goal for the club in a UEFA Cup qualifying first round match against EB/Streymur . However , on 28 August 2013 during Colin Murrays morning radio show with TalkSport Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside announced that the club had never officially signed the midfielder and that the necessary papers were just put in the draw . A Premier League investigation found that this wasnt the case and that Bolton had indeed signed Hamann , and expressed confusion as to why Gartside had lied about it . On 1 July 2009 , he was released by Manchester City as his contract expired . Hamann announced on 16 July that he intended to stay in England . On transfer deadline day in September 2009 , BBC Sport quoted Hamann as stating : Yes , Sven &lt;nowiki&gt; [ -Göran Eriksson ] &lt;/nowiki&gt; phoned me the other day to see if I wanted to sign for Notts County , but I said I wasnt interested at the moment as I feel I can still play at a higher level . There are a couple of things in Germany and Ill make my mind up by the end of the week . I have spoken to a couple of teams in England but that hasnt come to anything yet . Obviously , I can still sign after the deadline so maybe if teams dont get the players they want today then I will hear something . Milton Keynes Dons . On 20 May 2010 , Hamann signed a one-year contract as a player-coach at Milton Keynes Dons but only made 12 appearances as a player.When he left the club on 3 February 2011 to join Leicester City as a First Team Coach . he effectively retired from a playing career .

He was selected by manager Berti Vogts for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , being , at almost 25 , the second youngest player in an over-aged Germany squad . During the group stage , Hamann drifted in and out of the starting XI , finally breaking into the team when Germany gained momentum in the second round game against Mexico . However , after a quarter-final defeat against Croatia , Germany was out of the tournament . During the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying , Hamann established himself as a key player for a transitional Germany side . He played in all of Germanys games at the final tournament as they exited in the first round . Hamann was the last player to score at the old Wembley Stadium before its demolition when he scored the winning goal in Germanys qualifier for the 2002 World Cup against England in October 2000 . Alongside Michael Ballack and Bernd Schneider , Hamann was one of the key players in Germanys surprising run to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final . He became only the second Liverpool player after Roger Hunt in 1966 to play in a World Cup Final while still at the club , but finished on the losing side as Brazil won 2–0 in Yokohama . In the 67th minute of that match , Hamann lost the ball to opposing forward Ronaldo , who passed to Rivaldo , who shot from outside the area ; goalkeeper Oliver Kahn gave a rebound , allowing Ronaldo to score and give Brazil a 1–0 lead . The subsequent Euro 2004 turned out to be Hamanns last tournament . Again , the Euro ended with a disappointing first round exit for Germany . A 1–2 defeat against a Czech Republic side resting its key players proved to be Hamanns penultimate international game . After a strong performance in the 2005 Champions League final , Hamann was recalled for the Germany squad by new manager Jürgen Klinsmann . In the 2–2 draw against the Netherlands , Hamann produced a lacklustre performance , apparently convincing Klinsmann that he did not possess the required pace for that kind of level anymore . Hamann was dropped from the squad for the subsequent friendlies . Having not been selected for the German squad in the 2006 FIFA World Cup , he decided to officially retire from international football . Coaching and management career .

At the age of 12 he was scouted by Hannover 96 and joined the ranks of their youth teams . He became part of the first-team squad with 17 but never made it into the starting line-up .

He was awarded the title of International Grandmaster by FIDE in 1962 and was a frequent contender for the World Championship , although he never achieved that title . He was one of the strongest players in the world from the early 1960s until the late 1980s , as well as a distinguished author and opening theorist whose contributions in this field remain important to the present day . Career . Lev Polugaevsky was born in Mogilev , in the Soviet Union ( now Mahilyow , Belarus ) , and , after being evacuated during the Second World War , grew up in Kuybyshev ( modern Samara ) . He began playing chess around the age of 10 . In 1948 , he attracted the attention of Candidate Master Alexy Ivashin , who became his first teacher . International Master Lev Aronin , who lived in Moscow but had family in Kuybyshev , eventually became the teacher whom Polugaevsky credited most for his development . Additionally , between 1950 and 1953 he trained with Rashid Nezhmetdinov . Unlike many of his grandmaster colleagues , his development in chess came slowly , and he did not receive the Soviet master title until he was an adult . His progress then accelerated rapidly , however , and by the late 1960s he was one of the worlds strongest players , as was recognized by his participation in the famous USSR vs . Rest of the World match of 1970 . In this match he occupied fourth board , losing one game to Vlastimil Hort and drawing his other three . Until 1973 , Polugaevsky did not pursue chess as a career , working as an engineer and taking time off for tournaments . Polugaevsky won at Mar del Plata in 1962 and 1971 . He won or tied in the USSR Chess Championship three times . He played regularly in qualifying events to select a challenger for the world championship , qualifying for the Candidates matches on four occasions . His greatest advancement toward the title came during the 1977 and 1980 cycles , when he defeated Henrique Mecking and former world champion Mikhail Tal , respectively , in quarterfinal Candidates matches , before succumbing both times in the semifinals to the eventual challenger , Viktor Korchnoi . Polugaevsky played on the Soviet national team in seven Chess Olympiads , in 1966 , 1968 , 1970 , 1978 , 1980 , 1982 and 1984 . His team won the gold medal on each occasion , except in 1978 , when the USSR finished second to Hungary . Author . In addition to his over-the-board and theoretical successes , Polugaevsky was a highly respected chess author . His 1977 book Grandmaster Preparation ( now out of print ) is a classic that contains notable insights into his own thinking as he crafted the ultra-sharp eponymous variation in the main line ( 6 . Bg5 e6 7 . f4 b5 ) Najdorf Sicilian Defence . He went about his writing with the same meticulous care as characterized his analyses , and was contemptuous of the many less thorough authors who sought to profit from the post-Fischer chess boom with shoddy work , memorably commenting that Ninety per cent of all chess books you can open at page one and then immediately close again for ever . Sometimes you see books that have been written in one month . I dont like that . You should take at least two years for a book , or not do it [ at ] all . Books by Polugaevsky . - Queens Gambit : Orthodox Defence - Grandmaster Preparation , - Grandmaster Performance , - Grandmaster Achievement - Art of Defence in Chess - The Sicilian Labyrinth - Sicilian Love – Lev Polugaevsky Chess Tournament 1994 ( Buenos Aires ) , with Jeroen Piket , the New in Chess Editorial team , 1995 , 240 p. , Death . To celebrate Polugaevskys 60th birthday , a Sicilian Defence-themed tournament was held in recognition of his contributions to the opening . The event was funded by Luis Rentero and took place in Buenos Aires in October 1994 . Polugaevsky was too ill to participate . He died of a brain tumour in 1995 . Legacy . Polugaevsky was a noted theorist whose work on a number of openings has stood the test of time . He is best remembered for a variation of the Sicilian Defence that bears his name : 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 b5! ? This of the Najdorf Sicilian leads to extraordinarily complicated tactical play on which the last word has still not been said , although theory seems to give White the upper hand . Illustrative games . This game from the 1969 Soviet championship against Tal would seem at first glance to be an example of Polugaevsky beating The Magician from Riga at his own sacrificial game . More subtly , however , it also reveals the depth of his opening knowledge and preparation . Polugaevsky had worked with Boris Spassky as the latter was preparing for his successful 1969 world championship match with Tigran Petrosian , and the two had made a searching analysis of the opening used in this game . Polugaevsky remarked later that the position as late as move 25 had appeared on the board during his analysis on the morning of the game .</p><p>question: Which title was conferred to Lev Polugaevsky in 1953?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: Lev Polugaevsky was born in Mogilev , in the Soviet Union ( now Mahilyow , Belarus ) , and , after being evacuated during the Second World War , grew up in Kuybyshev ( modern Samara ) .

Study and first employment . In 1934 he began working in the Irbit City Inventory Bureau . From 1936 to 1938 he studied at the Workers Faculty of the Perm Agricultural Institute in Irbit . During his studies at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the Ural State University ( 1938–1942 ) , one of his mentors was . In 1942 , after graduating from the University , he began working as a spectroscopic engineer at Military Plant No . 217 “Geophysics” of Ministry of Armament ( presently Yalamov Urals Optical-Mechanical Plant ) evacuated from Moscow in 1941 . He worked first in the laboratory headed by , a graduate of the Physics Department of the Moscow State University , then until 1948 as a Head of the technological department at the same Plant . Work at the Ural State University . In 1951 , after graduating from PhD course , he defended his thesis on the topic “The Effect of Small Elastic Stresses on the Initial Susceptibility of Ferromagnetics ” . In 1950-1971 he worked as an assistant professor , then associate professor first of the Chair of Experimental Physics , then of the Chair of Magnetism ( since 1958 ) of the Physics Department of the Ural State University . The subject of study was the influence of the real ( defective ) crystal structure on the magnetic properties of magnetic materials , including those with rare-earth components . The phenomenological quantitative laws of the effect of the dislocations on the domain structure and the magnetic properties of electrical steels were established . In 1954–1955 , Professor and Associate Professor D . D . Mishin with graduate students investigated on the order of the Verkh-Isetsk Metallurgical Plant the nature for the uniformity of the magnetic properties of transformer steel along a sheet . D . D . Mishin was one of the founders and managers ( 1962-1971 ) of the Problem Laboratory of Permanent Magnets ( PLPM ) in the Ural State University ( presently , the Solid State Magnetism Department of the Research Institute of Physics and Applied Mathematics . In 1969 , the joint research work of the PLPM with the Pyshma Experimental Plant resulted in the organization of an experimental site for the production of permanent magnets based on rear earth metals-cobalt alloys . The first magnets were made only by pressing the original powder , later a special powder sintering technology was developed and applied , which made it possible to improve the magnetic and operational properties of permanent magnets . In 1970 , D . D . Mishin defended his doctoral ( habilitation ) dissertation on the topic : The Effect of Dislocation Structure on the Susceptibility and Coercive Force of Siliceous Iron . Work at Tver State University . In 1971 , D.D.Mishin moved to Kalinin and began working at the Kalinin State University ( KSU ) , transformed in the same year from a Pedagogical Institute to the University . In 1972 , he organized the Department of Magnetism at the Faculty of Physics of KSU . In PhD theses , his PhD students investigated the processes of magnetization reversal in rare-earth metal alloys ( Sm , Pr , Nd , Dy , etc. ) with metals of iron and boron groups . A method of fabrication of permanent magnets with sufficiently improved properties has been developed , the laws governing the changes in the domain structure during various effects on permanent magnets have been established . The implementation of the results of his work in the industry was noted by gold and silver medals of Soviet Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy in 1987-1990 . In 1988 , by the decision of the USSR Academy of Sciences , the XVIII All-Union Conference on the Physics of Magnetic Phenomena was held at the base of the Department of Magnetism in Tver . In 1996 , D . D . Mishin became an honorary professor at Tver State University . Scientific and educational activities . D . D . Mishins research interests were in the field of physics of magnetic phenomena , the physical properties of rare earth metals , their alloys and compounds , the processes of formation of a highly coercive state in new hard magnetic materials , the experimental production of high-energy permanent magnets . Under the leadership of D . D . Mishin , 2 doctors ( habilitate ) and 20 candidate of physical and mathematical sciences ( PhD ) were trained in the department . He developed new special courses : the physics of magnetic phenomena , the physics of real crystals , the physics of magnetic materials , the influence of physical factors on the properties of permanent magnets , and current problems of magnetism . Main publications . D . D . Mishin - author of about 200 scientific publications , 1 monograph and 15 certificates for inventions , 2 patents for inventions , 2 useful models , the sole inventor and patent owner of two inventions No . 2125333 and No . 2112294 .

Although Rainier was founded in 1884 , the Seattle site had been brewing beer since 1878 . The beer is no longer brewed in Seattle , nor is the company owned locally . In the late 1990s , the company was sold to Strohs , then to Pabst Brewing Company , though Miller contract brews most of Pabsts beers . The brewery was closed by Pabst in 1999 and sold . The brewery itself is a well-known fixture in the south end of town , adjacent to I-5 just north of the Spokane Street Viaduct . The plant is also home to the Tullys Coffee headquarters , Bartholomew Winery , Red Soul Motorcycle Fabrications , as well as artist lofts , band practice spaces , and a recording studio . The trademark red neon R that sat atop the building was replaced with a green T built by Western Neon , when Tullys was using the plant to roast coffee . The neon R is now on display at Seattles Museum of History and Industry which was refurbished by local Seattle sign company Western Neon . The green T was removed on September 30 , 2013 by Tullys , and a red neon replica R , built by Western Neon , returned to the top of the brewery on October 24 , 2013 . The brand is currently owned and operated by Pabst Brewing Company . In Canada , it is brewed and distributed by Sleeman Breweries as Rainier Lager . History . Origins . The original brewery dates all the way back to 1854 when A.B . Rabbeson opened Washington Brewery , which was Seattle’s first commercial brewing company . In 1872 , Rabbeson renamed his brewery Seattle Brewery . They launched Rainier beer in 1878 and would produce and distribute Rainier for the next decade . Concurrently , John Kopp and Andrew Hemrich founded Seattle Brewing and Malting in 1883 . In 1888 , Rabbeson sold his brewery , along with the Rainier brand , to Kopp and Hemrich . The Prohibition era . Kopp and Hemrich produced Rainier beer in Washington until 1916 , when the state of Washington enacted its own prohibition , 4 years before the 18th amendment enacted the nationwide prohibition . During this time they opened a brewery in San Francisco where they brewed Rainier beer until 1920 when the 18th amendment was ratified . The company survived prohibition by producing a variety of different nonalcoholic products . Post-Prohibition relaunch . Following the repeal of the Prohibition , the brewery was purchased by Lethbridge , Alberta brewers Fritz and Emil Sick , who then repurchased the Rainier brand and began brewing Rainier in 1935 . The brewery went through several names , such as Sicks Seattle Brewing and Malting and Sicks Rainier Brewing Company , during the 1935–1977 period . After Rainier Brewing Company resumed producing Rainier Beer after the end of Prohibition and its advertisements became ubiquitous in the Seattle-Tacoma area , a rumor began circulating that the brewerys owner , Emil Sick , had bribed a Washington state committee with free beer to name the local mountain Rainier . This , however , is an urban legend and can still be heard today among Tacoma residents who preferred the alternate name of Mount Tacoma . Sick did , however , purchase the local baseball team and named them the Seattle Rainiers for this purpose . Sicks also brewed Rainier at a branch brewery in Spokane , which closed in 1962 . Creative packaging . From 1952 to 1964 , Rainier came packaged in a series of decorative beer cans known as the Rainier Jubilee Series . First in the series were a set of Christmas cans marketed in late 1952 and again in late 1953 ; these cans are rare and highly collectible today . The Christmas cans proved such a success that Rainiers use of decorative Jubilee Series cans continued for over a decade , with thousands of different designs . Most of these are not as rare and collectible as the Christmas cans , but the reindeer cans ( which were sold only in Alaska ) , and the first pull tab Jubilee cans ( made only in the last couple of years of the Jubilee Series ) are also considered rare . Other brands of beer brewed by Sicks Rainier Brewing during this time included Rheinlander and Sicks Select . Later , the Rainier brewery would also take over brewing Heidelberg beer after its brewery in Tacoma , Washington , closed . Each of these brands ( as well as rival Northwest brands Lucky Lager , Olympia , and Blitz-Weinhard ) were once staples in the Pacific Northwest beer market , but starting in the 1960s and 1970s began losing market share to the major national brands . 1970s and 1980s advertising campaigns . During the 1970s , Rainier ran a number of memorable television ads in the Pacific Northwest , largely conceived by Seattle designer Terry Heckler , assisted by several of his staff , especially Ed Leimbacher , writer/producer for Rainier print , radio and TV for a dozen years . Sound man Joe Hadlock of Bear Creek Studio joined the colleagues of Heckler Bowker for 14 years of creating noise and music for these advertisements . Some of these surrealist advertisements noted by Seattle Magazine included the Running of the MFRs ( Mountain Fresh Rainiers ) ( a parody of Running of the Bulls featuring bottles with legs ) , and frogs that croaked Rainier Beer ( a motif appropriated many years later by Budweiser ) . Mickey Rooney appeared in several TV ads , most notably a parody of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonalds Indian Love Call from the 1936 MGM film Rose Marie . Mickey was dressed in a Mountie costume alongside his wife Jan as they sang . ( Most airings of this commercial ended with Rooney pouring a bottle of Rainier into her proffered glass , but occasionally a version was aired in which he poured the beer into her cleavage. ) A commercial ad featured a motorcycle that revved Raiiiiiiiii-nieeeeeeeer-Beeeeeeeer while zooming by along a mountain road was notable in the late 1970s and early 1980s . A version of this commercial that played on radio featured the sounds of different brands of motorcycles making the Rainier Beer revving sound. ) Other ads featured a Lawrence Welk double ( played by actor Pat Harrington , Jr. ) leading his band in The Wunnerful Rainier Waltz , complete with bubble machine and soloists blowing on beer bottles ; and a performance of a parody of the song Youre the Tops while thousands of Rainier bottle caps fell like dominoes in a giant R frame . ( The whole commercial was reportedly shot on the first take , a great relief since it took all day to set up. ) Rainier also produced humorous posters such as a National Beergraphic parody of a National Geographic Magazine cover depicting tourists encountering an MFR in the forest , and a Flash Gordon/Star Wars poster , Fresh Wars , that recalled the bar scene in [ [ Star Wars ( film ) |Star Wars : Episode 4 ] ] . There were even costumed MFRs that made promotional appearances at supermarkets during this period . Several commercials were parodies of movies , TV shows and famous spokespeople of the time . For example , a couple made references to popular [ [ Saturday Night Live ] ] skits : one with a [ [ Gilda Radner ] ] lookalike in her role as Roseanne Roseanneadanna in a [ [ Weekend Update ] ] skit for Rainier Lite commercial ; another had characters called the R-Heads , which was a reference to the [ [ Coneheads ] ] , with Rainier R logos on the top of their heads . Two commercials featured a Tarzan character where his yell is Raaaiiinn-iiieeer! . A commercial featured a silhouette of [ [ Alfred Hitchcock ] ] who would morph into a beer bottle . Another commercial featured a [ [ John Houseman ] ] imitator when Houseman at the time was a spokesperson for [ [ Morgan Stanley Wealth Management|Smith Barney ] ] . Another series of commercials featured a [ [ Lee Iacocca ] ] impersonator walking through stacks of beer cans . One final series of commercials was the [ [ John Rambo|Rambo ] ] like character called R-bo , played by [ [ Dan Roland ] ] . The R-bo commercials were filmed in three parts ; only two of those commercials aired , however . The third commercial was never seen , because Rainier Brewery was bought out by another brewing company which did not choose to continue the campaign . Demise . In 1977 the brewery was sold to [ [ G . Heileman Brewing Company ] ] , and passed through several more hands before finally winding up owned by [ [ Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst ] ] , which closed it in 1999 . The Rainier brand was sold to General Brewing Company , which moved production to the Olympia brewery in nearby [ [ Tumwater , Washington ] ] . The [ [ Olympia Brewing Company ] ] closed in 2003 . Rainier Beer is now brewed under contract in [ [ Irwindale , California ] ] . In 1999 , [ [ Sleeman Breweries ] ] of [ [ Guelph , Ontario ] ] , a division of [ [ Sapporo Breweries ] ] , acquired Stroh Canada which owned the Canadian rights to a folio of brands , including Rainier . Sleeman then became the Canadian manufacturer and distributor . In 1987 , Rainier was awarded a silver medal by the [ [ Great American Beer Festival ] ] in the category of Best American Light Lager . The [ [ GABF ] ] recognized Rainier again in 1990 , 1998 , and 2000 with the gold medal for Best American-Style Lager as well as silver medals in the same category in 2003 and 2005 . Both Rainier Light and Rainier Ice have received medals , in their respective categories , from the GABF . Rainier R logo . [ [ File:Rainier Beer and Mount Rainier from Mount St . Helens.jpg|thumb|Rainier Beer on Washington States [ [ Mount St . Helens ] ] with [ [ Mount Rainier ] ] in the background ] ] The red Rainier R logo has become an icon of the Rainier Brewing Company , dating back to the 1900s . The logo has gone through a few redesigns , having adopted the current R logo since the 1950s . Before that , the logo contained baseball style word mark with the R logo , shown in early 1900s advertisements up until the 1950s . After that , the word mark changed to go with the revised R logo , and it is still being used today . In 1953 , a large red neon R logo sign was created and placed atop the brewery . After Tullys leased the brewery in 2000 , they replaced the iconic R with a green neon Tullys T sign . The original red R sign was sold to the [ [ Museum of History &amp; Industry ( MOHAI ) ] ] , in which it is now on display at its new location at [ [ South Lake Union , Seattle ] ] . On September 18 , 2013 , Tullys ( under new owners ) decided to replace the green T with a replica of the red R sign . The green T sign was removed on September 30 , 2013 , and the new red R sign was installed on October 24 , 2013 . The replica R sign is different from the original R sign ; along with the new R having lights on both sides , the new sign is made of lighter [ [ aluminium ] ] , and it has [ [ Light-emitting diode|LED ] ] lights , requiring them to only replace the lights every five to seven years .

He served as a Teachta Dála ( TD ) from 1969 to 2004 . He led a Rainbow Coalition government of Fine Gael–Labour–Democratic Left . Bruton was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a TD for the Meath constituency in 1969 , and served continuously until his retirement from domestic politics in 2004 . He served as the Ambassador of the European Union to the United States from 2004 to 2009 , and is a former Vice-President of the European Peoples Party ( EPP ) . Early and personal life . John Gerard Bruton was born to a wealthy , Catholic farming family in Dunboyne , County Meath , and educated at Clongowes Wood College . Oliver Coogan notes in his Politics and War in Meath 1913–23 that Brutons granduncle was one of the farmers in south Meath who prevented the traditionally Anglo-Irish ascendency hunt from proceeding in the area during the Irish War of Independence . Bruton later went on to study at University College Dublin ( UCD ) , where he received an honours Bachelor of Arts degree and qualified as a barrister from Kings Inns , but never went on to practice law . Bruton was narrowly elected to Dáil Éireann in the 1969 general election , as a Fine Gael TD for Meath . At the age of 22 , he was one of the youngest ever members of the Dáil at that time . He more than doubled his vote in the 1973 general election , which brought Fine Gael to power as part of the National Coalition with the Labour Party . Bruton was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Minister for Education , in the National Coalition in 1973 . He remained in office until 1977 . He is married to Finola Bruton ( née Gill ) and they have four children . Shadow cabinet and in government . Following Fine Gaels defeat at the 1977 general election , Bruton was appointed to the new front bench as Spokesperson on Agriculture by its new leader , Garret FitzGerald . He was later promoted as Spokesperson for Finance , making a particular effective speech in the Dáil in response to the budget of 1980 . He played a prominent role in Fine Gaels campaign in the 1981 general election , which resulted in another coalition with the Labour Party , with FitzGerald as Taoiseach . Bruton received a huge personal vote in Meath , and at the age of only 34 was appointed Minister for Finance , the most senior position in the cabinet . The new government had to abandon its election promises to cut taxes in the light of overwhelming economic realities . The government collapsed unexpectedly on the night of 27 January 1982 , when Brutons controversial budget was defeated in the Dáil . The previously supportive Independent Socialist TD Jim Kemmy , voted against the budget , which proposed among other things the introduction of VAT on childrens shoes , thus causing the Dáil to be dissolved and Fine Gael to lose power . First leadership bid . The minority Fianna Fáil government which followed only lasted until November 1982 , when Fine Gael once again returned to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party , but when the new government was formed , Bruton was moved from Finance to become Minister for Industry and Energy . After a reconfiguration of government departments in 1983 , Bruton became Minister for Industry , Trade , Commerce and Tourism . In a cabinet reshuffle in 1986 , Bruton was appointed again as Minister for Finance . Although he was Minister for Finance , Bruton never presented his budget . The Labour Party withdrew from the government due to a disagreement over his budget proposals leading to the collapse of the government and another election . Following the 1987 general election Fine Gael suffered a heavy defeat . Garret FitzGerald resigned as leader immediately , and a leadership contest ensued between Alan Dukes , Peter Barry and Bruton himself . The exact result of the vote was not published . This was a severe blow as the victor , Dukes , was , like Bruton , one of the younger generation of politicians ( albeit a couple of years older than Bruton ) , but had been a TD for 12 years fewer . Bruton was of Fine Gaels christian democrat tradition , whereas Dukes was in FitzGeralds social democratic and liberal mould . Dukes was perceived to be a lacklustre leader however , who alienated his partys TDs and Senators and made little progress in recovering the ground lost by Fine Gael in 1987 . His Tallaght Strategy where he stated that he would support Fianna Fáil on economic reforms was also unpopular . The disastrous performance in the 1990 presidential election in which the party finished in a then humiliating and unprecedented third in a national election , proved to be the final straw for the party and Dukes was forced to resign as leader shortly after . Bruton , who was the deputy leader of Fine Gael at the time , was unopposed in the ensuing leadership election . Leadership of Fine Gael . Whereas Dukes came from the social democratic wing of Fine Gael , Bruton came from the more conservative wing . However to the surprise of critics and of conservatives , in his first policy initiative he called for a referendum on a Constitutional amendment permitting the enactment of legislation allowing for divorce in Ireland . Fine Gael had been in decline for nearly a decade ; from the high point of the November 1982 general election when it achieved 70 seats in Dáil Éireann ( only five seats short of Fianna Fáils total ) . The party had lost a considerable number of seats over the following ten years . Following the inexperienced Dukes disastrous period of leadership , Brutons election was seen as offering Fine Gael a chance to rebuild under a far more politically experienced leader . However Brutons perceived right wing persona and his rural background was used against him by critics and particularly by the media . By the 1992 general election , the anti-Fianna Fáil mood in the country produced a major swing to the opposition , but that support went to the Labour Party , not Brutons Fine Gael , which actually lost a further 10 seats . Even then , it initially appeared that Fine Gael was in a position to form a government . However , negotiations stalled in part from Labours refusal to be part of a coalition which would include the libertarian Progressive Democrats , as well as Brutons unwillingness to take Democratic Left into a prospective coalition . The Labour Party broke off talks with Fine Gael and opted to enter a new coalition with Fianna Fáil . It was a humiliating blow to Bruton , as the Labour Party was always seen as a natural ally of Fine Gael rather than Fianna Fáil . Fine Gael , and Bruton personally , continued to perform poorly in opinion polls throughout 1993 and early 1994 , Bruton narrowly survived a challenge to his leadership in early 1994 . However a couple of by-election victories , and a good performance in the 1994 European elections , coupled with a disastrous showing by the Labour Party , shored up his position . In late 1994 , the government of Fianna Fáils Albert Reynolds collapsed . Bruton was able to persuade Labour to end its coalition with Fianna Fáil and enter a new coalition government with Fine Gael and Democratic Left . Bruton faced charges of hypocrisy for agreeing to enter government with Democratic Left , as Fine Gael campaigned in the 1992 general election on a promise not to enter government with the party . Nevertheless , on 15 December , aged 47 , Bruton became the then youngest ever Taoiseach . This was the first time in the history of the state that a new government was installed without a general election being held . 10th Taoiseach ( 1994–1997 ) . Brutons politics were markedly different from most Irish leaders . Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin ( in its 1917–22 phase ) , Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party ( IPP ) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 general election . He hung a picture of IPP leader John Redmond , his political hero , on a wall in his office as Taoiseach , in preference to other figures such as Patrick Pearse . But as evidence of Brutons complexity , he also kept a picture of former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach Seán Lemass , which had been hung there by Reynolds , and which Bruton kept because he viewed Lemass as the best and most reforming Taoiseach in the history of the state . Continued developments in the Northern Ireland peace process and his attitude to Anglo-Irish relations came to define Brutons tenure as Taoiseach . In February 1995 , he launched the Anglo-Irish Framework Document with the British Prime Minister , John Major . This document outlined new proposed relations between Ireland , Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom . Many of Brutons opponents considered him to be too willing to accommodate unionist demands ( in one famous accusation , Albert Reynolds referred to him as John Unionist ) . However , he took a strongly critical position on the British Governments reluctance to engage with Sinn Féin during the IRAs 1994–1997 ceasefire . Bruton complained to a local radio reporter in Cork that I am sick of answering questions about the fucking peace process , for which he later apologised . Bruton also established a working relationship with Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin , however both were mutually distrustful of each other . The relationship became frayed following the ending of the ceasefire in 1996 , resulting in a bomb explosion in London . These relations worsened when the IRA killed Jerry McCabe , a member of the Garda Síochána , in a botched post office robbery in County Limerick , and another bomb explosion in Manchester . However , Bruton received widespread praise in the Republic for condemning the Royal Ulster Constabulary for yielding to loyalist threats at Drumcree by allowing members of the Orange Order to parade through a nationalist district . He stated that the RUC had been neither impartial nor consistent in applying the law . His outrage and criticism led to a tense atmosphere between London and Dublin . By the time of the 1997 general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 general election . He also presided over a successful Irish Presidency of the European Union in 1996 , and helped finalise the Stability and Growth Pact , which establishes macroeconomic parameters for countries participating in the single European currency , the euro . Bruton was the fifth Irish leader to address a joint session of the United States Congress on 11 September 1996 , as the 30th head of state or government of an EU country to do so since 1945 . Brutons government suffered from some allegations of corruption , and political embarrassment . In 1996 , his Minister for Transport , Michael Lowry , resigned from the cabinet after allegations that he had not paid income tax on payments from the supermarket tycoon , Ben Dunne , for work he had done for him as a businessman prior to becoming a Minister . His Minister of State at the Department of Finance also resigned , on 9 February 1995 , as a result of leaks from the Department of Finance . Additionally , many years later Frank Dunlop made allegations before the planning tribunal that he had informed Bruton about demands for a £250,000 bribe made to him by a Fine Gael Dublin City Councillor , Tom Hand , to rezone the Quarryvale development . Dunlop testified that when he informed Bruton of the bribery attempts , Bruton replied , There are no angels in the world or in Fine Gael . Bruton vehemently denied this and Fine Gael counsel told the Planning Tribunal in 2003 : I refute entirely Mr Dunlops contention that he advised me then of the alleged demand made to him by the late Tom Hand . However , following further evidence at the tribunal , Bruton returned to it in October 2007 , and conceded that it gradually came back to me , that Dunlop , did say to me something about a Councillor looking for money . But , in his own evidence to the tribunal in 2007 , Dunlop himself said that he had not mentioned any figure of 250,000 to Bruton in his 1993 conversation with him . Bruton presided over the first official visit by a member of the British Royal Family since 1912 , the Charles , Prince of Wales . His welcome speech to Prince Charles , was viewed by many journalists negatively in Ireland . In Britain , The Times accused him of being embarrassingly effusive while The Guardian lambasted that Bruton get a grip on his extravagantly nonsensical attitudes . Bruton himself viewed the fact that the heir to the British throne could visit the Republic successfully , as marking an important turning point in Anglo-Irish relations and stands over the comments he made as appropriate in the circumstances . Following the murder of crime journalist Veronica Guerin , his government established the Criminal Assets Bureau . Post-Taoiseach period . The government was widely expected to win re-election in 1997 . While Fine Gael gained nine seats , Labour was severely mauled , losing 16 seats . This left Bruton far short of the parliamentary support he needed to retain office , and he resigned . A Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrat coalition led by Bertie Ahern came into power , with Bruton reverting to leadership of the opposition . Fine Gael became paralysed in opposition . Bruton was deposed from leadership in 2001 , in favour of Michael Noonan , due in part to fears Fine Gael would suffer severe losses in the 2002 election . However , Noonan failed to live up to expectations and the party suffered an even greater collapse than had been expected under Bruton . Having gone into the election expecting to increase its seat count from 54 to 60 , it only won 31 . This not only tied Fine Gaels second-worst performance in an election , but was 39 seats less than at its high point twenty years earlier in 1982 . Bruton , a passionate supporter of European integration , was chosen as one of the two Irish Parliament Representatives to the European Convention , which helped draft the proposed European Constitution . He was one of two National Parliament Representatives to sit on the 12-member Praesidium , which helped steer the European Convention . He is a member of the Comite dHonneur of the Institute of International and European Affairs , along with Peter Sutherland and Bertie Ahern . He accepted an offer to become European Union Ambassador to the United States , in the summer of 2004 , and after resigning from the Dáil on 31 October 2004 , he assumed that office . Bruton was praised by Ahern , who said Bruton had played a pivotal role in developing Irelands relations with the European Union . Bruton received an Honorary Doctorate from Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2003 , and from the University of Missouri in 2009 . He regularly lectures at national and international universities . In early 2004 , he accepted a position as Adjunct Faculty Member in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University . In November 2008 , he received the Order of the Polar Star award from the Government of Sweden . His brother , Richard Bruton , is also a Fine Gael politician , and has served in a number of ministerial roles , most recently as Minister for Communications , Climate Action and Environment . On 29 October 2009 , it was announced that he had written to the Ambassadors to the United States of the 27 members of the European Union expressing his interest in applying for the position of President of the European Council following implementation of the Lisbon Treaty . Bruton was very much an outside shot for the position as EU leaders firmly indicated they want a chairman-style president rather than a high-profile figurehead to fill the post . Herman Van Rompuy , the then Belgian Prime Minister , was appointed President of the European Council on 19 November 2009 and took office on 1 December 2009 . On 21 May 2010 , it was announced that he would be the chairman of the newly formed financial services body , IFSC Ireland . His main role will be to promote Ireland as a location of choice for international financial services . Bruton was widely discussed as a candidate for the 2011 presidential election and was approached by Fine Gael with the opportunity to become their candidate ; on 28 May 2011 , however , Bruton issued a statement that he was flattered to be asked , but would not be a candidate for the presidency . Since November 2011 , Bruton acts as an advisor to Fair Observer focusing mainly on the areas of politics , finance and economics as well as on issues pertaining to Europe . Bruton receives annual pension payments of €141,849 . In September 2014 , on the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Home Rule Bill , Bruton said the 1916 Easter Rising was a mistake and an unjust war . Bruton supported the No campaign during the 2018 Irish referendum on abortion .

Annan and the UN were the co-recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize . He was the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation , as well as chairman of The Elders , an international organization founded by Nelson Mandela . Annan studied economics at Macalester College , international relations at the Graduate Institute Geneva , and management at MIT . Annan joined the UN in 1962 , working for the World Health Organizations Geneva office . He went on to work in several capacities at the UN Headquarters including serving as the Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping between March 1992 and December 1996 . He was appointed the Secretary-General on 13 December 1996 by the Security Council , and later confirmed by the General Assembly , making him the first office holder to be elected from the UN staff itself . He was re-elected for a second term in 2001 , and was succeeded as Secretary-General by Ban Ki-moon on 1 January 2007 . As the Secretary-General , Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy ; worked to combat HIV/AIDS , especially in Africa ; and launched the UN Global Compact . He was criticized for not expanding the Security Council and faced calls for his resignation after an investigation into the Oil-for-Food Programme , but was largely exonerated of personal corruption . After the end of his term as UN Secretary-General , he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation in 2007 to work on international development . In 2012 , Annan was the UN–Arab League Joint Special Representative for Syria , to help find a resolution to the ongoing conflict there . Annan quit after becoming frustrated with the UNs lack of progress with regards to conflict resolution . In September 2016 , Annan was appointed to lead a UN commission to investigate the Rohingya crisis . He died in 2018 and was given a state funeral . Early years and education . Kofi Annan was born in Kumasi in the Gold Coast ( now Ghana ) on 8 April 1938 . His twin sister Efua Atta , who died in 1991 , shared the middle name Atta , which in the Akan language means twin . Annan and his sister were born into one of the countrys Fante aristocratic families ; both of their grandfathers and their uncle were Fante paramount chiefs . In the Akan names tradition , some children are named according to the day of the week on which they were born , sometimes in relation to how many children precede them . Kofi in Akan is the name that corresponds with Friday , the day of which Annan was born . Annan said that his surname rhymes with cannon in English . the last name Annan in Fante means fourth born child . From 1954 to 1957 , Annan attended the elite Mfantsipim , an all-boys Methodist boarding school in Cape Coast founded in the 1870s . Annan said that the school taught him that suffering anywhere , concerns people everywhere . In 1957 , the year Annan graduated from Mfantsipim , the Gold Coast gained independence from the UK and began using the name Ghana . In 1958 , Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology , now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana . He received a Ford Foundation grant , enabling him to complete his undergraduate studies in economics at Macalester College in St . Paul , Minnesota , United States , in 1961 . Annan then completed a diplôme détudes approfondies DEA degree in International Relations at The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva , Switzerland , from 1961 to 1962 . After some years of work experience , he studied at the MIT Sloan School of Management ( 1971–72 ) in the Sloan Fellows program and earned a masters degree in management . Annan was fluent in English , French , Akan , and some Kru languages as well as other African languages . Career . In 1962 , Kofi Annan started working as a budget officer for the World Health Organization , an agency of the United Nations ( UN ) . From 1974 to 1976 , he worked as a manager of the state-owned Ghana Tourist Development Company in Accra . In 1980 he became the head of personnel for the office of the UN High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) in Geneva . Between 1981 and 1983 he was a member of the Governing Board of the International School of Geneva . In 1983 he became the director of administrative management services of the UN Secretariat in New York . In 1987 , Annan was appointed as an Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management and Security Coordinator for the UN system . In 1990 , he became Assistant Secretary-General for Program Planning , Budget and Finance , and Control . When Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali established the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ( DPKO ) in 1992 , Annan was appointed to the new department as Deputy to then Under-Secretary-General Marrack Goulding . Annan was subsequently appointed in March 1993 as Under-Secretary-General of that department . On 29 August 1995 , while Boutros-Ghali was unreachable on an airplane , Annan instructed United Nations officials to relinquish for a limited period of time their authority to veto air strikes in Bosnia . This move allowed NATO forces to conduct Operation Deliberate Force and made him a favorite of the United States . According to Richard Holbrooke , Annans gutsy performance convinced the United States that he would be a good replacement for Boutros-Ghali . He was appointed a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the former Yugoslavia , serving from November 1995 to March 1996 . Criticism . In 2003 , retired Canadian General Roméo Dallaire , who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda , claimed that Annan was overly passive in his response to the imminent genocide . In his book Shake Hands with the Devil : The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda ( 2003 ) , Dallaire asserted that Annan held back UN troops from intervening to settle the conflict , and from providing more logistical and material support . Dallaire claimed that Annan failed to provide responses to his repeated faxes asking for access to a weapons depository ; such weapons could have helped Dallaire defend the endangered Tutsis . In 2004 , ten years after the genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed , Annan said , I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support . In his book , Annan again argued that the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations could have made better use of the media to raise awareness of the violence in Rwanda and put pressure on governments to provide the troops necessary for an intervention . Annan explained that the events in Somalia and the collapse of the UNOSOM II mission fostered a hesitation among UN Member states to approve robust peacekeeping operations . As a result , when the UNAMIR mission was approved just days after the battle , the resulting force lacked the troop levels , resources and mandate to operate effectively . Secretary-General of the United Nations ( 1997–2006 ) . Appointment . In 1996 , Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for a second term . Although he won 14 of the 15 votes on the Security Council , he was vetoed by the United States . After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council , Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy , becoming the only Secretary-General ever to be denied a second term . Annan was the leading candidate to replace him , beating Amara Essy by one vote in the first round . However , France vetoed Annan four times before finally abstaining . The UN Security Council recommended Annan on 13 December 1996 . Confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly , he started his first term as Secretary-General on 1 January 1997 . Due to Boutros-Ghalis overthrow , a second Annan term would give Africa the office of Secretary-General for three consecutive terms . In 2001 , the Asia-Pacific Group agreed to support Annan for a second term in return for the African Groups support for an Asian Secretary-General in the 2006 selection . The Security Council recommended Annan for a second term on 27 June 2001 , and the General Assembly approved his reappointment on 29 June 2001 . Activities . Recommendations for UN reform . Soon after taking office in 1997 , Annan released two reports on management reform . On 17 March 1997 , the report Management and Organisational Measures ( A/51/829 ) introduced new management mechanisms through the establishment of a cabinet-style body to assist him and be grouping the UNs activities in accordance with four core missions . A comprehensive reform agenda was issued on 14 July 1997 entitled Renewing the United Nations : A Programme for Reform ( A/51/950 ) . Key proposals included the introduction of strategic management to strengthen unity of purpose , the establishment of the position of Deputy Secretary-General , a 10-percent reduction in posts , a reduction in administrative costs , the consolidation of the UN at the country level , and reaching out to civil society and the private sector as partners . Annan also proposed to hold a Millennium Summit in 2000 . After years of research , Annan presented a progress report , In Larger Freedom , to the UN General Assembly , on 21 March 2005 . Annan recommended Security Council expansion and a host of other UN reforms . On 31 January 2006 , Annan outlined his vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN in a policy speech to the United Nations Association UK . The speech , delivered at Central Hall , Westminster , also marked the 60th Anniversary of the first meetings of the General Assembly and Security Council . On 7 March 2006 , he presented to the General Assembly his proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the United Nations Secretariat . The reform report is entitled Investing in the United Nations , For a Stronger Organization Worldwide . On 30 March 2006 , he presented to the General Assembly his analysis and recommendations for updating the entire work programme of the United Nations Secretariat . The reform report is entitled : Mandating and Delivering : Analysis and Recommendations to Facilitate the Review of Mandates . Regarding the UN Human Rights Council , Annan said declining credibility had cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations system . Unless we re-make our human rights machinery , we may be unable to renew public confidence in the United Nations itself . However , he did believe that , despite its flaws , the council could do good . In March 2000 , Annan appointed the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to assess the shortcomings of the then existing system and to make specific and realistic recommendations for change . The panel was composed of individuals experienced in conflict prevention , peacekeeping and peace-building . The report it produced , which became known as the Brahimi Report , after Chair of the Panel Lakhdar Brahimi , called for : 1 . renewed political commitment on the part of Member States ; 2 . significant institutional change ; 3 . increased financial support . The Panel further noted that in order to be effective , UN peacekeeping operations must be properly resourced and equipped , and operate under clear , credible and achievable mandates . In a letter transmitting the report to the General Assembly and Security Council , Annan stated that the Panels recommendations were essential to make the United Nations truly credible as a force for peace . Later that same year , the Security Council adopted several provisions relating to peacekeeping following the report , in Resolution 1327 . Millennium Development Goals . In 2000 , Annan issued a report entitled : We the peoples : the role of the United Nations in the 21st century . The report called for member states to put people at the centre of everything we do . No calling is more noble , and no responsibility greater , than that of enabling men , women and children , in cities and villages around the world , to make their lives better . In the final chapter of the report , Annan called to free our fellow men and women from the abject and dehumanizing poverty in which more than 1 billion of them are currently confined . At the Millennium Summit in September 2000 , national leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration , which was subsequently implemented by the United Nations Secretariat as the Millennium Development Goals in 2001 . United Nations Information Technology Service ( UNITeS ) . Within the We the Peoples document , Annan suggested the establishment of a United Nations Information Technology Service ( UNITeS ) , a consortium of high-tech volunteer corps , including NetCorps Canada and Net Corps America , which United Nations Volunteers would co-ordinate . In the Report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology ( 22 May 2000 ) suggesting a UN ICT Task Force , the panel welcomed the establishment of UNITeS , and made suggestions on its configuration and implementation strategy , including that ICT4D volunteering opportunities make mobilizing national human resources ( local ICT experts ) within developing countries a priority , for both men and women . The initiative was launched at the United Nations Volunteers and was active from February 2001 to February 2005 . Initiative staff and volunteers participated in the World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) in Geneva in December 2003 . The United Nations Global Compact . In an address to The World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999 , Secretary-General Annan argued that the goals of the United Nations and those of business can , indeed , be mutually supportive and proposed that the private sector and the United Nations initiate a global compact of shared values and principles , which will give a human face to the global market . On 26 July 2000 , the United Nations Global Compact was officially launched at UN headquarters in New York . It is a principle-based framework for businesses which aims to Catalyse actions in support of broader UN goals , such as the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . The Compact established ten core principles in the areas of human rights , labour , the environment and anti-corruption , and under the Compact , companies commit to the ten principles and are brought together with UN agencies , labour groups and civil society to effectively implement them . Establishment of The Global Fund . Towards the end of the 1990s , increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda . In April 2001 , Annan issued a five-point Call to Action to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic . Stating it was a personal priority , Annan proposed the establishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund , dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV/AIDS crisis . In June of that year , the General Assembly of the United Nations committed to the creation of such a fund during a special session on AIDS , and the permanent secretariat of the Global Fund was subsequently established in January 2002 . Responsibility to Protect . Following the failure of Annan and the International Community to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda and in Srebrenica , Annan asked whether the international community had an obligation in such situations to intervene to protect civilian populations . In a speech to the General Assembly on 20 September 1999 to address the prospects for human security and intervention in the next century , Annan argued that individual sovereignty—the protections afforded by the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the UN—was being strengthened , while the notion of state sovereignty was being redefined by globalization and international co-operation . As a result , the UN and its member states had to consider a willingness to act to prevent conflict and civilian suffering , a dilemma between two concepts of sovereignty that Annan also presented in a preceding article in The Economist , on 16 September 1999 . In September 2001 the Canadian government established an ad hoc committee to address this balance between state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention . The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty published its final report in 2001 , which focused on not on the right of states to intervene but a responsibility to protect populations at risk . The report moved beyond the question of military intervention , arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations . In 2005 , Annan included the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect in his report Larger Freedom . When that report was endorsed by the UN General Assembly , it amounted to the first formal endorsement by UN Member States of the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect . Iraq . In the years after 1998 when UNSCOM was expelled by the government of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis , in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq , former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive to the demands of the Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites , often Presidential palaces , that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value , severely hampering UNSCOMs ability to co-operate with the Iraqi government and contributed to their expulsion from the country . Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM , which caused intelligence processing ( and the resulting inspections ) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result , they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan , which could have taken days , if not weeks . He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections . He claimed that on one occasion , Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access , but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks , giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site . During the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , Annan called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the United Nations . In a September 2004 interview on the BBC , when questioned about the legal authority for the invasion , Annan said he believed it was not in conformity with the UN charter and was illegal . Other diplomatic activities . In 1998 , Annan was deeply involved in supporting the transition from military to civilian rule in Nigeria . The following year , he supported the efforts of East Timor to secure independence from Indonesia . In 2000 , he was responsible for certifying Israel s withdrawal from Lebanon , and in 2006 , he led talks in New York between the presidents of Cameroon and Nigeria which led to a settlement of the dispute between the two countries over the Bakassi peninsula . Annan and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad disagreed sharply on Irans nuclear program , on an Iranian exhibition of cartoons mocking the Holocaust , and on the then upcoming International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust , an Iranian Holocaust denial conference in 2006 . During a visit to Iran instigated by continued Iranian uranium enrichment , Annan said I think the tragedy of the Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact and we should really accept that fact and teach people what happened in World War II and ensure it is never repeated . Annan supported sending a UN peacekeeping mission to Darfur , Sudan . He worked with the government of Sudan to accept a transfer of power from the African Union peacekeeping mission to a UN one . Annan also worked with several Arab and Muslim countries on womens rights and other topics . Beginning in 1998 , Annan convened an annual UN Security Council Retreat with the 15 States representatives of the council . It was held at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund ( RBF ) Conference Center at the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills , New York , and was sponsored by both the RBF and the UN . Lubbers sexual-harassment investigation . In June 2004 , Annan was given a copy of the Office of Internal Oversight Services ( OIOS ) report on the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers , UN High Commissioner for Refugees , for sexual harassment , abuse of authority , and retaliation . The report also reviewed a long-serving staff members allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter , Director of UNHCR Personnel . The investigation found Lubbers guilty of sexual harassment ; no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official , or two subsequent complaints filed later that year . In the course of the official investigation , Lubbers wrote a letter which some considered was a threat to the female worker who had brought the charges . On 15 July 2004 , Annan cleared Lubbers of the accusations , saying they were not substantial enough legally . The internal UN-OIOS report on Lubbers was leaked , and sections accompanied by an article by Kate Holt were published in a British newspaper . In February 2005 , Lubbers resigned as head of the UN refugee agency , saying that he wanted to relieve political pressure on Annan . Oil-for-Food scandal . In December 2004 , reports surfaced that the Secretary-Generals son Kojo Annan received payments from the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA , which had won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil-for-Food Programme . Kofi Annan called for an investigation to look into the allegations . On 11 November 2005 , The Sunday Times agreed to apologise and pay a substantial sum in damages to Kojo Annan , accepting that the allegations were untrue . Annan appointed the Independent Inquiry Committee , which was led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , then the director of the United Nations Association of the US . In his first interview with the Inquiry Committee , Annan denied having had a meeting with Cotecna . Later in the inquiry , he recalled that he had met with Cotecnas chief executive Elie-Georges Massey twice . In a final report issued on 27 October , the committee found insufficient evidence to indict Kofi Annan on any illegal actions , but did find fault with Benon Sevan , an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years . Appointed by Annan to the Oil-For-Food role , Sevan repeatedly asked Iraqis for allocations of oil to the African Middle East Petroleum Company . Sevans behavior was ethically improper , Volcker said to reporters . Sevan repeatedly denied the charges and argued that he was being made a scapegoat . The Volcker report was highly critical of the UN management structure and the Security Council oversight . It strongly recommended a new position be established of Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) , to handle the fiscal and administrative responsibilities then under the Secretary-Generals office . The report listed the companies , both Western and Middle Eastern , which had benefited illegally from the program . Nobel Peace Prize . In 2001 , its centennial year , the Nobel Committee decided that the Peace Prize was to be divided between the UN and Annan . They were awarded the Peace Prize for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world , having revitalized the UN and for having given priority to human rights . The Nobel Committee also recognized his commitment to the struggle to containing the spread of HIV in Africa and his declared opposition to international terrorism . Relations between the United States and the United Nations . Annan defended his deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown , who openly criticized the United States in a speech on 6 June 2006 : [ T ] he prevailing practice of seeking to use the UN almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics is simply not sustainable . You will lose the UN one way or another . [ ... ] [ That ] the US is constructively engaged with the UN [ ... ] is not well known or understood , in part because much of the public discourse that reaches the US heartland has been largely abandoned to its loudest detractors such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News . Malloch later said his talk was a sincere and constructive critique of U.S . policy toward the U.N . by a friend and admirer . The talk was unusual because it violated unofficial policy of not having top officials publicly criticize member nations . The interim U.S . ambassador John R . Bolton , appointed by President George W . Bush , was reported to have told Annan on the phone : Ive known you since 1989 and Im telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior UN official that I have seen in that entire time . Observers from other nations supported Mallochs view that conservative politicians in the U.S . prevented many citizens from understanding the benefits of U.S . involvement in the UN . Farewell addresses . On 19 September 2006 , Annan gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York , in anticipation of his retirement on 31 December . In the speech he outlined three major problems of an unjust world economy , world disorder , and widespread contempt for human rights and the rule of law , which he believed have not resolved , but sharpened during his time as Secretary-General . He also pointed to violence in Africa , and the Arab–Israeli conflict as two major issues warranting attention . On 11 December 2006 , in his final speech as Secretary-General , delivered at the Harry S . Truman Presidential Library in Independence , Missouri , Annan recalled Trumans leadership in the founding of the United Nations . He called for the United States to return to President Trumans multilateralist foreign policies , and to follow Trumans credo that the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not dominate the peoples of the world . He also said that the United States must maintain its commitment to human rights , including in the struggle against terrorism . Online access to Kofi Annans archives .

After his service as UN Secretary-General , Annan took up residence in Geneva and worked in a leading capacity on various international humanitarian endeavors . Kofi Annan Foundation . In 2007 , Annan established the Kofi Annan Foundation , an independent , not-for-profit organization that works to promote better global governance and strengthen the capacities of people and countries to achieve a fairer , more peaceful world . The organisation was founded on the principles that fair and peaceful societies rest on three pillars : Peace and Security , Sustainable Development , and Human Rights and the Rule of Law , and they have made it their mission to mobilise the leadership and the political resolve needed to tackle threats to these three pillars ranging from violent conflict to flawed elections and climate change , with the aim of achieving a fairer , more peaceful world . The Foundation provides the analytical , communication and co-ordination capacities needed to ensure that these objectives are achieved . Annans contribution to peace worldwide is delivered through mediation , political mentoring , advocacy and advice . Through his engagement , Annan aimed to strengthen local and international conflict resolution capabilities . The Foundation provides the analytical and logistical support to facilitate this in co-operation with relevant local , regional and international actors . The Foundation works mainly through private diplomacy , where Annan provided informal counsel and participated in discreet diplomatic initiatives to avert or resolve crises by applying his experience and inspirational leadership . He was often asked to intercede in crises , sometimes as an impartial independent mediator , sometimes as a special envoy of the international community . In recent years he had provided such counsel to Burkina Faso , Kenya , Myanmar , Senegal , Iraq and Colombia . Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation Process ( KNDR ) . Following the outbreak of violence during the 2007 Presidential elections in Kenya , the African Union established a Panel of Eminent African Personalities to assist in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis . The panel , headed by Annan , managed to convince the two principal parties to the conflict , President Mwai Kibakis Party of National Unity ( PNU ) and Raila Odingas Orange Democratic Movement ( ODM ) , to participate in the Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation Process ( KNDR ) . Over the course of 41 days of negotiations , several agreements regarding taking actions to stop the violence and remedying its consequences were signed . On 28 February , President Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga signed a coalition government agreement . Joint Special Envoy for Syria . On 23 February 2012 , Annan was appointed as the UN-Arab League envoy to Syria , in an attempt to end the civil war taking place . He developed a six-point plan for peace : 1 . commit to work with the Envoy in an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people , and , to this end , commit to appoint an empowered interlocutor when invited to do so by the Envoy ; 2 . commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians and stabilise the country . - To this end , the Syrian government should immediately cease troop movements towards , and end the use of heavy weapons in , population centres , and begin pullback of military concentrations in and around population centres . - As these actions are being taken on the ground , the Syrian government should work with the Envoy to bring about a sustained cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties with an effective United Nations supervision mechanism . - Similar commitments would be sought by the Envoy from the opposition and all relevant elements to stop the fighting and work with him to bring about a sustained cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties with an effective United Nations supervision mechanism ; 3 . ensure timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and to this end , as immediate steps , to accept and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause and to co-ordinate exact time and modalities of the daily pause through an efficient mechanism , including at local level ; 4 . intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons , including especially vulnerable categories of persons , and persons involved in peaceful political activities , provide without delay through appropriate channels a list of all places in which such persons are being detained , immediately begin organizing access to such locations and through appropriate channels respond promptly to all written requests for information , access or release regarding such persons ; 5 . ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists and a non-discriminatory visa policy for them ; 6 . respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed . On 2 August , he resigned as UN and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria , citing the intransigence of both the Assad government and the rebels , as well as the stalemate on the Security Council as preventing any peaceful resolution of the situation . Annan also stated that the lack of international unity and ineffective diplomacy among the world leaders had made the peaceful resolution in Syria an impossible task . Global Commission on Elections , Democracy and Security . Annan served as the Chair of the Global Commission on Elections , Democracy and Security . The commission was launched in May 2011 as a joint initiative of the Kofi Annan Foundation and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance . It comprised 12 eminent individuals from around the world , including Ernesto Zedillo , Martti Ahtisaari , Madeleine Albright and Amartya Sen , and aimed to highlight the importance of the integrity of elections to achieving a more secure , prosperous and stable world . The Commission released its final report : Democracy , a Strategy to Improve the Integrity of Elections Worldwide , in September 2012 . Rakhine Commission ( Myanmar ) . In September 2016 , Annan was asked to lead the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State ( in Myanmar ) – an impoverished region beset by ethnic conflict and extreme sectarian violence , particularly by Myanmars Buddhist majority against the Rohingya Muslim minority , further targeted by government forces . The commission , widely known simply as the Annan Commission , was opposed by many Myanmar Buddhists as unwelcome interference in their relations with the Rohingya . When the Annan commission released its final report , the week of 24 August 2017 , with recommendations unpopular with all sides , violence exploded in the Rohingya conflict – the largest and bloodiest humanitarian disaster in the region in decades – driving most of the Rohingya from Myanmar . Annan attempted to engage the United Nations to resolve the matter , but failed . Annan died a week before the first anniversary of the report , shortly after an announcement by a replacement commission that it would not point fingers at the guilty parties – leading to widespread concern that the new commission was just a sham to protect culpable Myanmar government officials and citizens from accountability . In 2018 , before Annans death , Myanmars civilian government , under the direction of State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi , made a gesture of acceptance of the Annan commissions recommendations by convening another board – the Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State – ostensibly to implement the Annan commissions proposed reforms , but never actually implemented them . Some of the international representatives resigned – notably the panels Secretary , Thailands former foreign minister Surakiart Sathirathai , and former U.S . ambassador to the U.N . Bill Richardson – decrying the implementation committee as ineffective , or a whitewash . Other activities . Corporate boards In March 2011 , Annan became a member of the Advisory Board for Investcorp Bank B . S . C . Europe , an international private equity firm and sovereign wealth fund owned by the United Arab Emirates . He held the position until 2018 . Annan became member of the Global Advisory Board of Macro Advisory Partners LLP , Risk and strategic consulting firm based in London and New York , for business , finance and government decision-makers , with some operations related to Investcorp . Non-profit organizations In addition to the above , Annan also became involved with several organizations with both global and African focuses , including the following : - United Nations Foundation , member of the board of directors ( 2008–2018 ) - University of Ghana , chancellor ( 2008–2018 ) - School of International and Public Affairs of Columbia University , global fellow ( 2009–2018 ) - The Committee on Global Thought at Columbia University , fellow - Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) , Li Ka Shing Professor ( 2009–2018 ) - Global Centre for Pluralism , member of the board of directors ( 2010–2018 ) - Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership , chairman of the prize committee ( 2007–2018 ) - Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ( AGRA ) , chairman ( 2007–2018 ) - Global Humanitarian Forum , founder and president ( 2007–2018 ) - Global Commission on Drug Policy , founding commissioner . The commission had declared in a 2011 report that the war on drugs was a failure . Annan believed that , since drug use represents a health risk , it should be regulated , comparing it to the regulation of tobacco which reduced smoking in many countries . Annan served as Chair of The Elders , a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues . In November 2008 , Annan and fellow Elders Jimmy Carter and Graça Machel attempted to travel to Zimbabwe to make a first-hand assessment of the humanitarian situation in the country . Refused entry , the Elders instead carried out their assessment from Johannesburg , where they met Zimbabwe- and South Africa-based leaders from politics , business , international organisations , and civil society . In May 2011 , following months of political violence in Côte dIvoire , Annan travelled to the country with Elders Desmond Tutu and Mary Robinson to encourage national reconciliation . On 16 October 2014 , Annan attended the One Young World Summit in Dublin . During a session with fellow Elder Mary Robinson , Annan encouraged 1,300 young leaders from 191 countries to lead on intergenerational issues such as climate change and the need for action to take place now , not tomorrow . We dont have to wait to act . The action must be now . You will come across people who think we should start tomorrow . Even for those who believe action should begin tomorrow , remind them tomorrow begins now , tomorrow begins today , so lets all move forward . Annan chaired the Africa Progress Panel ( APP ) , a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa . As Chair , he facilitates coalition building to leverage and broker knowledge , in addition to convening decision-makers to influence policy and create lasting change in Africa . Every year , the Panel releases a report , the Africa Progress Report , which outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies . In 2014 , the Africa Progress Report highlighted the potential of African fisheries , agriculture , and forests to drive economic development . The 2015 report explores the role of climate change and the potential of renewable energy investments in determining Africas economic future . Memoir . On 4 September 2012 , Annan with Nader Mousavizadeh wrote a memoir , . Published by Penguin Press , the book has been described as a personal biography of global statecraft . Personal life . In 1965 , Kofi Annan married Titi Alakija , a Nigerian woman from an aristocratic family . Several years later they had a daughter , Ama , and later a son , Kojo . The couple separated in the late 1970s , and divorced in 1983 . In 1984 , Annan married , a Swedish lawyer at the UN and a maternal half-niece of diplomat Raoul Wallenberg . She has a daughter , Nina , from a previous marriage . His brother , Kobina Annan served as Ghanas ambassador to Morocco . Death and state funeral . Annan died on the morning of 18 August 2018 in Bern , Switzerland at the age of 80 , after what his family described as a short illness . António Guterres , the current UN Secretary-General , said that Kofi Annan was a champion for peace and a guiding force for good . The body of Kofi Annan was returned to his native Ghana from Geneva in a brief and solemn ceremony at the Kotoka International Airport in Accra , on 10 September 2018 . His coffin , draped in the blue UN flag , was accompanied by his widow Nane Annan , his children and senior diplomats from the international organisation . On 13 September 2018 , a state funeral was held for Annan in Ghana at the Accra International Conference Centre . The ceremony was attended by several political leaders from across Africa as well as Ghanaian traditional rulers , European royalty and dignitaries from the international community , including the U.N . Secretary-General António Guterres . Prior to the funeral service , his body lay in state in the foyer of the same venue , from 11–12 September 2018 . A private burial followed the funeral service at the new Military Cemetery at Burma Camp , with full military honours and the sounding of the Last Post by army buglers and a . Memorials and legacy . The United Nations Postal Administration released a new stamp in memory of Kofi Annan on 31 May 2019 . Annans portrait on the stamp was designed by artist Martin Mörck . The Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre and the Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT , both in Accra , are named in his honour . The is also named after him .</p><p>question: Which school did Kofi Annan go to from 1958 to 1961?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: In 1958 , Annan began studying economics at the Kumasi College of Science and Technology , now the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology of Ghana .

Annan then completed a diplôme détudes approfondies DEA degree in International Relations at The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva , Switzerland , from 1961 to 1962 . After some years of work experience , he studied at the MIT Sloan School of Management ( 1971–72 ) in the Sloan Fellows program and earned a masters degree in management .</p><p>pred_time: Kumasi College of Science and Technology</p><p>groundtruth: </p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-233"/wiki/Kevin_Kyle#P54#1</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Kevin_Kyle#P54#1<p>context: Kevin Kyle Kevin Alastair Kyle ( born 7 June 1981 ) is a Scottish retired footballer and media personality , who played as a centre forward . He played for 11 senior clubs in his career . Kyle gained 10 full Scotland international caps . Early life . Kyle was born and grew up in Stranraer , Scotland where as well as playing for his school team and local amateur sides he was selected to play for Dumfries and Galloway region . Also in the same Dumfries and Galloway team was fellow Stranraer boy Allan Jenkins . Playing career . Sunderland . Kyle began his career as a youth at Ayr United before joining Sunderland in 1998 , where he was a prolific scorer for their reserves . However , he was unable to force his way into a first team that boasted the striking talent of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn . Instead , he gained first team experience on loan with Huddersfield , Darlington and Rochdale . It was on loan at Darlington that Kyle scored his first career goals , notching against Sudbury in the FA Cup and Mansfield Town in the league . After finally breaking into the Sunderland first team in the 2003–04 season he ended up as their joint top goalscorer with 16 goals to help them to the play-offs . However , he missed most of the following season owing to a hip injury and his recovery was aided by visits to Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt and American hip surgeon Marc Phillipon . He returned to first team action in February 2006 , scoring his first and only Premier League goal in March 2006 , away to Manchester City , in a season that saw Sunderland relegated on a then-record low points tally . Coventry City . Kyle then joined Coventry City on 25 August 2006 for £600,000 , but only went on to score three goals during the campaign . He scored just two more . Out of favour with the Sky Blues and despised by their fans , he traded a relegation battle with Coventry for a promotion push with a loan to fellow Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers during the latter half of the 2007–08 season , reuniting him with his former Sunderland boss Mick McCarthy . He made 13 appearances , nine as substitute , scoring once against Crystal Palace . While Wolves finished seventh , outside the play-offs , his move was not made permanent as Kyle said he would rather return to Coventry , who finished a point clear of the relegation positions in 21st , in the summer . After failing to feature at all during the opening stages of the next season for his parent club , he joined Hartlepool United on a months loan on 1 October 2008 . The loan was later extended until the end of the year , and Kyle scored five goals in 15 starts . Kilmarnock . On 27 January 2009 , Coventry announced that they had reached an agreement with Kyle over the remaining six months of his contract , and he had left the club by mutual consent . Two days later , he signed for Kilmarnock on an 18-month contract . On 31 January 2009 he scored a headed goal on his debut for Kilmarnock against St Mirren and this goal was also the first at the new St Mirren Park . On 11 April he scored all three goals , his first ever professional hat-trick , in a 3–0 victory against Falkirk for which he received a standing ovation when he was substituted . Kyle was praised for his part in keeping Killie in the SPL that season . In the games following the 2008–2009 season Scottish Premier League split , Kyle scored all of Kilmarnocks goals in a draw with Falkirk and victories against St Mirren and Inverness Caledonian Thistle thus helping the team secure 8th place and SPL survival . He scored eight goals in total that season . Kyle was made Kilmarnock club captain for the 2009–10 season . He started where he left off by scoring twice in the opening day 3–0 home victory over Hamilton and his good form won him a recall to the Scotland squad after an absence of five years . In the Scottish League Cup game against Morton ( in which he also scored ) he suffered a knee injury , sidelining him for three weeks and causing him to miss the final two World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and the Netherlands on 5 and 10 September 2009 .

Early life . At the age of fourteen , Holtzman visited the Société Anonyme’s 1926 “International Exhibition of Modern Art” at the Brooklyn Museum and developed an early interest in advanced art with the guidance and encouragement of a high school teacher . At sixteen , in 1928 , he began attending the Art Students League of New York and became an active participant in League activities , serving as a monitor and contributing to the quarterly magazine . At a membership meeting in early 1932 , Holtzman’s remarks against the xenophobia of the League’s director were instrumental in carrying a membership vote that brought George Grosz and Hans Hofmann to teach at the League . At the close of this meeting , Burgoyne Diller , a Hofmann protégé , taken by Holtzman’s independence of mind , introduced himself , beginning an important lasting relationship . ( 1 ) ( 5 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) In this period and working directly from the nude Harry Holtzman produced a wide corpus of drawings that reveals a progressive evolution towards abstraction , expressing his clearly understanding of the Cézannes lesson. ( 1 ) ( 3 ) Step by step his work , using his own words , become absolutely pure , very much in a kind of expressionist so called abstract expressionism vene ( 3 ) Harry Holtzman was part of the first exhibition of abstract art organized at the Art Student League , with B.Diller , Albert Swinden , Albert Wilkenson . ( 1 ) From 1933 the Abstract research of the artist evolves then into a series of rectilinear works , basically an independent abstraction from external objects , an important work of this period is Dynamic Equilibrium of Movement and Contromovement ( #661 Estate of Harry Holtzman ) . An untitled gouache painting of the same year ( # 606 Estate of Harry Holtzman ) shows the carried on argument with Diller over whether circular forms could be integrated into a grid arrangement without seeming to be indiscreet and arbitrary , from this discussion Harry Holtzman decided they could not . ( 9 ) ( 11 ) By January 1934 , Holtzman recalls , In the ensuing months , Holtzman By the end of November , Holtzman had raised enough money to pay for passage to France . In mid-December he introduced himself to Mondrian in the Dutch artist’s Paris studio . Despite a language barrier and an age difference of forty years , the two men became good friends during the four months of Holtzman’s stay in Paris . When Holtzman returned to New York City in 1935 , he joined the WPA Federal Art project , but was first assigned to write for the public relations department , since his art was considered too extreme for public placement . When Diller was promoted as managing supervisor of the Mural Division in New York , he appointed Holtzman as his assistant supervisor in charge of the abstract mural painters . In 1936 Holtzman was instrumental in bringing together the nucleus of painters and sculptors who established the American Abstract Artists in 1937 . Although he opposed the group’s emphasis on exhibitions , and the attempts of certain influential members to exclude all but “pure-abstractionists” , Holtzman maintained an active role for several years , serving as secretary in 1938 and again in 1940 and arranged for the three-week AAA exhibition and its educational component at the American Art Today Building of the New York World’s Fair in 1940 , directed by Holger Cahill . New York during WWII . During the German Blitz of London in 1940 , Holtzman arranged for Mondrian to come to New York , where he arrived that October . Holtzman rented an apartment-studio for him , and during the next three and a half years he was one of Mondrian’s most intimate associates . ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Of a painting construction ( Sculpture 1941 ) by Harry Holtzman now in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery , Piet Mondrian commented : “In the present three dimensional works of H.H . ( Harry Holtzman ) the picture moves still more from the wall into our surrounding space . In this way the painting more literally annihilates the three dimensional volume.” ( letter to Harry Holtzman 6 1 1942 cited by Daniel Abadie in the catalogue Paris New York Paris , Paris Musee National dArt Moderne Centre Georges Pompidou 1977 ) ( 2 ) ( 4 ) The piece , included in the Spring Salon for Young Artists ( 18 May - 26 June 1943 ) at the Art of This Century gallery in New York , was also shown in the Maya Derens film Witchs Cradle filmed at the AoTC during the August 1943 . Holtzman was associated with the Atelier 17 printmaking studio . According to Nancy J . Troy Holtzmans sculptures are akin to works by European and American artists who sought to apply Mondrians principle of Neoplasticism into the three dimensions . Cesar Domela , Jean Gorin , B Diller , worked out from the painted surface but still adhering to that surface for their overall concept . Harry Holtzman set out in a new direction by working in the round . ( 4 ) As executor of Mondrian’s Estate , Holtzman continued his involvement with Mondrian’s art and in 1983 he co-edited a volume of Mondrian’s complete essays . ( 1 ) ( 8 ) Post-war . In 1947 , Holtzman became a faculty member of the Institute for General Semantics , where he taught with Alfred Korzybski until 1954 . Later he edited the journal Trans/Formation : Arts , Communications , Environment . ( 1 ) Since 1957 , Harry Holtzman , visited the Asian continent documenting its life and culture and gathering an important photographic documentation , relevant both from the artistic and ethnographic point of view . Some of his best photographs relating to the Village Gods of South India were selected by Stella Kramrisch for the catalogue and exhibition Unknown India ritual art in tribe and village ( Philadelphia Museum of Fine Art 1968 ) . The Museum of Modern Art of New York included in 1962 some of his photographs of Le Corbusiers Villa Shodhan in the circulating exhibition : The Twentieth Century House . ( 1 ) The evolution of the artistic research of Harry Holtzman of these decades led him to illustrate semanticims theory of the interrelation of symbolization and perception in some of his works . The end result of this long research was a series of open reliefs : free standing structures painted to stimulate the visual interchange between the rectilinear solids and the voids as they were shaped by the solids , representing in their interaction the movement and space in viable experience . ( 1 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) These final works were exhibited in public for the first time three years after the death of Harry Holtzman , in 1990 at the Washburn Gallery of New York . ( 12 ) For many years he participated in the conferences of the National Committee on Art Education of The Museum of Modern Art , and from 1950 to 1975 he was a faculty member of the art department at Brooklyn College , City University of New York .

Holtzman writes from New York insisting that he come , sending money and promising to find lodgings . * 1940 : June 26 , Dutch passport stamped with exemption from military service and permission to leave the country . - August : with Holtzman’s help , he receives an American visa . As soon as Mondrian gets a place in the Dutch immigration quota , he packs his paintings and sends them to America . - September 9 : two days after the blitz begins , a bomb hits the other side of Parkhill Road several houses away , breaking his windows and thus forcing him to leave . For the rest of the time he lives at the Ormonde Hotel in London . - September 13 : writes farewell letters to Nicholson , Hepworth , and Winfred Nicholson . - September 21 : boards ship in Liverpool , but does not leave until two days later because of the blitz . - October 3 , 1940 : Mondrian arrives in New York : Holtzman is waiting on the pier and takes him to the Beekman tower on east 49th St. , where Mondrian spends his first few days . Knowing his passion for jazz , Holtzman almost immediately plays some recordings of boogie-woogie music , a rhythmically propulsive form of piano blues then enjoying a popular revival , which Mondrian , Holtzman will recall , finds “Enormous , enormous” . Holtzman takes Mondrian to his summer home in the Berkshires to recuperate from the journey , then finds him an apartment on the third floor of 353 East 56th st. , on the corner of first ave . Holtzman will pay the rent and buy him a bed and after Mondrian resists for several months , a record player . p.2-hh-new art-new-life : p.5-6-hh-new-art-new-life:bottom… In New York , unless I was away from the city , we saw each other almost every day to discuss our work and ideas . It was also my privilege to help Mondrian put his writing into “correct” English . Although I have no direct knowledge , early photos and self-portraits of Holtzman show him as somewhat romantic in appearance , then dapper , energetic , proud and lively . Mondrian was among the first in Europe to write about the importance to modern culture of black American jazz and its dances , which he thoroughly enjoyed until the end of his life . In Paris he had a large collection of jazz discs . On the night Mondrian arrived in New York , I introduced him to the boogie-woogie piano music of Ammons , Johnson , and Lewis . His response was immediate , he clasped his hands together with obvious pleasure , “Enormous ! Enormous!” he repeated . He often went with me and others to enjoy what he called a “dancing party.” Nobody has ever written more brilliantly about the symbolic ambiance of the night club .

When Diller was promoted as managing supervisor of the Mural Division in New York , he appointed Holtzman as his assistant supervisor in charge of the abstract mural painters . In 1936 Holtzman was instrumental in bringing together the nucleus of painters and sculptors who established the American Abstract Artists in 1937 . Although he opposed the group’s emphasis on exhibitions , and the attempts of certain influential members to exclude all but “pure-abstractionists” , Holtzman maintained an active role for several years , serving as secretary in 1938 and again in 1940 and arranged for the three-week AAA exhibition and its educational component at the American Art Today Building of the New York World’s Fair in 1940 , directed by Holger Cahill . During the German Blitz of London in 1940 , Holtzman arranged for Mondrian to come to New York , where he arrived that October . Holtzman rented an apartment-studio for him , and during the next three and a half years he was one of Mondrian’s most intimate associates . ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Selected works of the Artist are present in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art , New York ( Square volume with green , 1936 ) ; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ( Horizontal Volume , 1938-1946 ) ; Carnegie Museum of Art , Pittsburgh ( Sculpture I , 1940 ; Lateral Volume No . 1 , 1939-40 ) ; Société Anonyme Yale University Art Gallery ( Sculpture 1941–1942 ; Lateral Volume No . 2 , 1940 ) ; Florence Griswold Museum , Old Lyme , CT ; Beineke Rare Book and Manuscript Library Yale University , New Haven , CT . In 2014 Harry Holtzman and George L.K . Morris , founding members of the American Abstract Artists are paired in an intimate 2-man exhibit , curated by Kinney Frelinghuysen and Madalena Holtzman , and designed to evoke an informal conversation between the two artists .

Catalogue published on the occasion of the exhibition from June 26 to October 12 , 2014 , at the Frelinghuysen Morris House and Studio , Lenox , Massachusetts . This exhibition marks also the beginning of a collaboration between the Estates of George L.K . Morris and Harry Holtzman , with support of the RKD - Netherlands Institute for Art History . The collaboration aims at sharing , editing and exhibiting new historical materials related and connected to the world of abstract art of the seminal period of the 1930s and 1940s in Europe and in the US . For this reason in this first show will be present also the works of other European protagonists of the time like Jean Hélion , Cesar Domela , and Ben Nicholson . * 1940 : June 26 , Dutch passport stamped with exemption from military service and permission to leave the country . - October 3 , 1940 : Mondrian arrives in New York : Holtzman is waiting on the pier and takes him to the Beekman tower on east 49th St. , where Mondrian spends his first few days .

The city serves as the administrative center of Novgorod Oblast . The city lies along the Volkhov River just downstream from its outflow from Lake Ilmen and is situated on the M10 federal highway connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg . UNESCO recognized Novgorod as a World Heritage Site in 1992 . The city has a population of At its peak during the 14th century , the city was the capital of the Novgorod Republic and was one of Europes largest cities . The Veliky ( great ) part was eventually added to the citys name to differentiate it from another city with a similar name , Nizhny Novgorod ( lower newtown ) . History . Early developments . The Sofia First Chronicle makes initial mention of it in 859 , while the Novgorod First Chronicle first mentions it in 862 , when it was purportedly already a major Baltics-to-Byzantium station on the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks . The Charter of Veliky Novgorod recognizes 859 as the year when the city was first mentioned . Novgorod is traditionally considered to be a cradle of Russian statehood . The oldest archaeological excavations in the middle to late 20th century , however , have found cultural layers dating back to the late 10th century , the time of the Christianization of Rus and a century after it was allegedly founded . Archaeological dating is fairly easy and accurate to within 15–25 years , as the streets were paved with wood , and most of the houses made of wood , allowing tree ring dating . The Varangian name of the city or ( or ) is mentioned in Norse Sagas as existing at a yet earlier stage , but the correlation of this reference with the actual city is uncertain . Originally , referred to the stronghold , now only to the south of the center of the present-day city , Rurikovo Gorodische ( named in comparatively modern times after the Varangian chieftain Rurik , who supposedly made it his capital around 860 ) . Archaeological data suggests that the Gorodishche , the residence of the Knyaz ( prince ) , dates from the mid-9th century , whereas the town itself dates only from the end of the 10th century ; hence the name Novgorod , new city , from Old Church Slavonic and ( and ) , although German and Scandinavian historiography suggests the Old Norse term , or the Old High German term . First mention of this Nordic or Germanic etymology to the name of the city of Novgorod ( and that of other cities within the territory of the then Kievan Rus ) occurs in the 10th-century policy manual by Byzantine emperor Constantine VII . Slightly predating the chronology of the legend of Rurik ( which dates the first Norse arrival in the region around 858–860 ) , an earlier record for the Scandinavian settlement of the region is found in the ( written up until 882 ) where a Rus delegation is mentioned as having visited Constantinople in 838 and , intending to return to the Rus Khaganate via the Baltic Sea , were questioned by Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious at , where they said that although their origin was Swedish , they had settled in Northern Rus under a leader whom they designated as ( the Latin form of Khagan , a title they had likely borrowed from contact with the Avars ) . Princely state within Kievan Rus . In 882 , Ruriks successor , Oleg of Novgorod , conquered Kiev and founded the state of Kievan Rus . Novgorods size as well as its political , economic , and cultural influence made it the second most important city in Kievan Rus . According to a custom , the elder son and heir of the ruling Kievan monarch was sent to rule Novgorod even as a minor . When the ruling monarch had no such son , Novgorod was governed by posadniks , such as the legendary Gostomysl , Dobrynya , Konstantin , and Ostromir . Of all their princes , Novgorodians most cherished the memory of Yaroslav the Wise , who sat as Prince of Novgorod from 1010 to 1019 , while his father , Vladimir the Great , was a prince in Kiev . Yaroslav promulgated the first written code of laws ( later incorporated into Russkaya Pravda ) among the Eastern Slavs and is said to have granted the city a number of freedoms or privileges , which they often referred to in later centuries as precedents in their relations with other princes . His son , Vladimir , sponsored construction of the great St . Sophia Cathedral , more accurately translated as the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom , which stands to this day . Early foreign ties . In Norse sagas the city is mentioned as the capital of Gardariki . Four Viking kings—Olaf I of Norway , Olaf II of Norway , Magnus I of Norway , and Harald Hardrada—sought refuge in Novgorod from enemies at home . No more than a few decades after the 1030 death and subsequent canonization of Olaf II of Norway , the citys community had erected in his memory Saint Olafs Church in Novgorod . The Gotland town of Visby functioned as the leading trading center in the Baltic before the Hansa League . At Novgorod in 1080 , Visby merchants established a trading post which they named Gutagard ( also known as Gotenhof ) . Later , in the first half of the 13th century , merchants from northern Germany also established their own trading station in Novgorod , known as Peterhof . At about the same time , in 1229 , German merchants at Novgorod were granted certain privileges , which made their position more secure . Novgorod Republic . In 1136 , the Novgorodians dismissed their prince Vsevolod Mstislavich . The year is seen as the traditional beginning of the Novgorod Republic . The city was able to invite and dismiss a number of princes over the next two centuries , but the princely office was never abolished and powerful princes , such as Alexander Nevsky , could assert their will in the city regardless of what Novgorodians said . The city state controlled most of Europes northeast , from lands east of todays Estonia to the Ural Mountains , making it one of the largest states in medieval Europe , although much of the territory north and east of Lakes Ladoga and Onega was sparsely populated and never organized politically . One of the most important local figures in Novgorod was the posadnik , or mayor , an official elected by the public assembly ( called the Veche ) from among the citys boyars , or aristocracy . The tysyatsky , or thousandman , originally the head of the town militia but later a commercial and judicial official , was also elected by the Veche . Another important local official was the Archbishop of Novgorod who shared power with the boyars . Archbishops were elected by the Veche or by the drawing of lots , and after their election , were sent to the metropolitan for consecration . While a basic outline of the various officials and the Veche can be drawn up , the city-states exact political constitution remains unknown . The boyars and the archbishop ruled the city together , although where one officials power ended and anothers began is uncertain . The prince , although his power was reduced from around the middle of the 12th century , was represented by his namestnik , or lieutenant , and still played important roles as a military commander , legislator and jurist . The exact composition of the Veche , too , is uncertain , with some historians , such as Vasily Klyuchevsky , claiming it was democratic in nature , while later scholars , such as Marxists Valentin Ianin and Aleksandr Khoroshev , see it as a sham democracy controlled by the ruling elite . In the 13th century , Novgorod , while not a member of the Hanseatic League , was the easternmost kontor , or entrepôt , of the league , being the source of enormous quantities of luxury ( sable , ermine , fox , marmot ) and non-luxury furs ( squirrel pelts ) . Throughout the Middle Ages , the city thrived culturally . A large number of birch bark letters have been unearthed in excavations , perhaps suggesting widespread literacy . It was in Novgorod that the Novgorod Codex , the oldest Slavic book written north of Bulgaria , and the oldest inscription in a Finnic language ( Birch bark letter no . 292 ) were unearthed . Some of the most ancient Russian chronicles ( Novgorod First Chronicle ) were written in the scriptorium of the archbishops who also promoted iconography and patronized church construction . The Novgorod merchant Sadko became a popular hero of Russian folklore . Novgorod was never conquered by the Mongols during the Mongol invasion of Rus . The Mongol army turned back about from the city , not because of the citys strength , but probably because the Mongol commanders did not want to get bogged down in the marshlands surrounding the city . However , the grand princes of Moscow , who acted as tax collectors for the khans of the Golden Horde , did collect tribute in Novgorod , most notably Yury Danilovich and his brother , Ivan Kalita . In 1259 , Mongol tax-collectors and census-takers arrived in the city , leading to political disturbances and forcing Alexander Nevsky to punish a number of town officials ( he cut off their noses ) for defying him as Grand Prince of Vladimir ( soon to be the khans tax-collector in Russia ) and his Mongol overlords . In the 14th century , raids by Novgorod pirates , or ushkuiniki , sowed fear as far as Kazan and Astrakhan , assisting Novgorod in wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow . During the era of Old Rus State , Novgorod was a trade hub at the northern end of both the Volga trade route and the route from the Varangians to the Greeks along the Dnieper river system . A vast array of goods were transported along these routes and exchanged with local Novgorod merchants and other traders . The farmers of Gotland retained the Saint Olof trading house well into the 12th century . Later German merchantmen also established tradinghouses in Novgorod . Scandinavian royalty would intermarry with Russian princes and princesses . After the great schism , Novgorod struggled from the beginning of the 13th century against Swedish , Danish , and German crusaders . During the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars , the Swedes invaded lands where some of the population had earlier paid tribute to Novgorod . The Germans had been trying to conquer the Baltic region since the late 12th century . Novgorod went to war 26 times with Sweden and 11 times with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword . The German knights , along with Danish and Swedish feudal lords , launched a series of uncoordinated attacks in 1240–1242 . Novgorodian sources mention that a Swedish army was defeated in the Battle of the Neva in 1240 . The Baltic German campaigns ended in failure after the Battle on the Ice in 1242 . After the foundation of the castle of Viborg in 1293 the Swedes gained a foothold in Karelia . On August 12 , 1323 , Sweden and Novgorod signed the Treaty of Nöteborg , regulating their border for the first time . The citys downfall occurred partially as a result of its inability to feed its large population , making it dependent on the Vladimir-Suzdal region for grain . The main cities in the area , Moscow and Tver , used this dependence to gain control over Novgorod . Eventually Ivan III forcibly annexed the city to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1478 . The Veche was dissolved and a significant part of Novgorods aristocracy , merchants and smaller landholding families was deported to central Russia . The Hanseatic League kontor was closed in 1494 and the goods stored there were seized by Muscovite forces . Tsardom of Russia . At the time of annexation , Novgorod became the third largest city under Muscovy and then the Tsardom of Russia ( with 5,300 homesteads and 25–30 thousand inhabitants in the 1550s ) and remained so until the famine of the 1560s and the Massacre of Novgorod in 1570 . In the Massacre , Ivan the Terrible sacked the city , slaughtered thousands of its inhabitants , and deported the citys merchant elite and nobility to Moscow , Yaroslavl and elsewhere . The last decade of the 16th century was a comparatively favorable period for the city as Boris Godunov restored trade privileges and raised the status of Novgorod bishop . The German trading post was reestablished in 1603 . Even after the incorporation into the Russian state Novgorod land retained its distinct identity and institutions , including the customs policy and administrative division . Certain elective offices were quickly restored after having been abolished by Ivan III . During the Time of Troubles , Novgorodians submitted to Swedish troops led by Jacob De la Gardie in the summer of 1611 . The city was restituted to Muscovy six years later by the Treaty of Stolbovo . The conflict led to further depopulation : the number of homesteads in the city decreased from 1158 in 1607 to only 493 in 1617 , with the Sofia side described as deserted . Novgorod only regained a measure of its former prosperity towards the end of the century , when such ambitious buildings as the Cathedral of the Sign and the Vyazhischi Monastery were constructed . The most famous of Muscovite patriarchs , Nikon , was active in Novgorod between 1648 and 1652 . The Novgorod Land became one of the Old Believers strongholds after the Schism . The city remained an important trade centre even though it was now eclipsed by Archangelsk , Novgorodian merchants were trading in the Baltic cities and Stockholm while Swedish merchants came to Novgorod where they had their own trading post since 1627 . Novgorod continued to be a major centre of crafts which employed the majority of its population . There were more than 200 distinct professions in 16th century . Bells , cannons and other arms were produced in Novgorod ; its silversmiths were famous for the skan technique used for religious items and jewellery . Novgorod chests were in widespread use all across Russia , including the Tsars household and the northern monasteries . Russian Empire . In 1727 , Novgorod was made the administrative center of Novgorod Governorate of the Russian Empire , which was detached from Saint Petersburg Governorate ( see Administrative divisions of Russia in 1727–1728 ) . This administrative division existed until 1927 . Between 1927 and 1944 , the city was a part of Leningrad Oblast , and then became the administrative center of the newly formed Novgorod Oblast . Modern era . On August 15 , 1941 , during World War II , the city was occupied by the German Army . Its historic monuments were systematically obliterated . The Red Army the city on January 19 , 1944 . Out of 2,536 stone buildings , fewer than forty remained standing . After the war , thanks to plans laid down by Alexey Shchusev , the central part was gradually restored . In 1992 , the chief monuments of the city and the surrounding area were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list as the Historic Monuments of Novgorod and Surroundings . In 1999 , the city was officially renamed Veliky Novgorod ( literally , Great Novgorod ) , thus partly reverting to its medieval title Lord Novgorod the Great . This reduced the temptation to confuse Veliky Novgorod with Nizhny Novgorod , a larger city the other side of Moscow which , between 1932 and 1990 , had been renamed Gorky , in honor of Maxim Gorky . Administrative and municipal status . Veliky Novgorod is the administrative center of the oblast and , within the framework of administrative divisions , it also serves as the administrative center of Novgorodsky District , even though it is not a part of it . As an administrative division , it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Veliky Novgorod—an administrative unit with status equal to that of the districts . As a municipal division , the city of oblast significance of Veliky Novgorod is incorporated as Veliky Novgorod Urban Okrug . Sights . The city is known for the variety and age of its medieval monuments . The foremost among these is the St . Sophia Cathedral , built between 1045 and 1050 under the patronage of Vladimir Yaroslavich , the son of Yaroslav the Wise ; Vladimir and his mother , Anna Porphyrogenita , are buried in the cathedral . It is one of the best preserved churches from the 11th century . It is also probably the oldest structure still in use in Russia and the first one to represent original features of Russian architecture ( austere stone walls , five helmet-like domes ) . Its frescoes were painted in the 12th century originally on the orders of Bishop Nikita ( died 1108 ) ( the porches or side chapels were painted in 1144 under Archbishop Nifont ) and renovated several times over the centuries , most recently in the nineteenth century . The cathedral features famous bronze gates , which now hang in the west entrance , allegedly made in Magdeburg in 1156 ( other sources see them originating from Płock in Poland ) and reportedly snatched by Novgorodians from the Swedish town of Sigtuna in 1187 . More recent scholarship has determined that the gates were most likely purchased in the mid-15th century , apparently at the behest of Archbishop Euthymius II ( 1429–1458 ) , a lover of Western art and architectural styles . The Novgorod Kremlin , traditionally known as the Detinets , also contains the oldest palace in Russia ( the so-called Chamber of the Facets , 1433 ) , which served as the main meeting hall of the archbishops ; the oldest Russian bell tower ( mid-15th century ) , and the oldest Russian clock tower ( 1673 ) . The Palace of Facets , the bell tower , and the clock tower were originally built on the orders of Archbishop Euphimius II , although the clock tower collapsed in the 17th century and had to be rebuilt and much of the palace of Euphimius II is no longer standing . Among later structures , the most remarkable are a royal palace ( 1771 ) and a bronze monument to the Millennium of Russia , representing the most important figures from the countrys history ( unveiled in 1862 ) . Outside the Kremlin walls , there are three large churches constructed during the reign of Mstislav the Great . St . Nicholas Cathedral ( 1113–1123 ) , containing frescoes of Mstislavs family , graces Yaroslavs Court ( formerly the chief square of Novgorod ) . The Yuriev Monastery ( one of the oldest in Russia , 1030 ) contains a tall , three-domed cathedral from 1119 ( built by Mstislavs son , Vsevolod , and Kyurik , the head of the monastery ) . A similar three-domed cathedral ( 1117 ) , probably designed by the same masters , stands in the Antoniev Monastery , built on the orders of Antony , the founder of that monastery . There are now some fifty medieval and early modern churches scattered throughout the city and its surrounding areas . Some of them were blown up by the Nazis and subsequently restored . The most ancient pattern is represented by those dedicated to Saints Pyotr and Pavel ( on the Swallows Hill , 1185–1192 ) , to Annunciation ( in Myachino , 1179 ) , to Assumption ( on Volotovo Field , 1180s ) and to St . Paraskeva-Piatnitsa ( at Yaroslavs Court , 1207 ) . The greatest masterpiece of early Novgorod architecture is the Savior church at Nereditsa ( 1198 ) . In the 13th century , tiny churches of the three-paddled design were in vogue . These are represented by a small chapel at the Peryn Monastery ( 1230s ) and St . Nicholas on the Lipnya Islet ( 1292 , also notable for its 14th-century frescoes ) . The next century saw the development of two original church designs , one of them culminating in ( 1360–1361 , fine frescoes from 1380s ) , and another one leading to the Savior church on Ilyina street ( 1374 , painted in 1378 by Feofan Grek ) . The Savior church in Kovalevo ( 1345 ) was originally frescoed by Serbian masters , but the church was destroyed during the war . While the church has since been rebuilt , the frescoes have not been restored . During the last century of the republican government , some new churches were consecrated to Saints Peter and Paul ( on Slavna , 1367 ; in Kozhevniki , 1406 ) , to Christs Nativity ( at the Cemetery , 1387 ) , to St . John the Apostles ( 1384 ) , to the Twelve Apostles ( 1455 ) , to St Demetrius ( 1467 ) , to St . Simeon ( 1462 ) , and other saints . Generally , they are not thought to be as innovative as the churches from the previous period . Several shrines from the 12th century ( i.e. , in Opoki ) were demolished brick by brick and then reconstructed exactly as they used to be , several of them in the mid-fifteenth century , again under Archbishop Yevfimy II ( Euthymius II ) , perhaps one of the greatest patrons of architecture in medieval Novgorod . Novgorods conquest by Ivan III in 1478 decisively changed the character of local architecture . Large commissions were thenceforth executed by Muscovite masters and patterned after cathedrals of Moscow Kremlin : e.g. , the Savior Cathedral of Khutyn Monastery ( 1515 ) , the Cathedral of the Mother of God of the Sign ( 1688 ) , the St . Nicholas Cathedral of Vyaschizhy Monastery ( 1685 ) . Nevertheless , the styles of some parochial churches were still in keeping with local traditions : e.g. , the churches of Myrrh-bearing Women ( 1510 ) and of Saints Boris and Gleb ( 1586 ) . In Vitoslavlitsy , along the Volkhov River and the Myachino Lake , close to the Yuriev Monastery , a museum of wooden architecture was established in 1964 . Over twenty wooden buildings ( churches , houses and mills ) dating from the 14th to the 19th century were transported there from all around the Novgorod region . 11400 graves of the German 1st Luftwaffe Field Division are found at the war cemetery in Novgorod . Also 1900 soldiers of the Spanish Blue Division are buried there . Transportation . Intercity transport . Novgorod has connections to Moscow ( 531 km ) and St . Petersburg ( 189 km ) by the federal highway M10 . There are public buses to Saint Petersburg and other destinations . The city has direct railway passenger connections with Moscow ( Leningradsky Rail Terminal , by night trains ) , St . Petersburg ( Moscow Rail Terminal and Vitebsk Rail Terminal , by suburban trains ) , Minsk ( Belarus ) ( Minsk Passazhirsky railway station , by night trains ) and Murmansk . The citys former commercial airport Yurievo was decommissioned in 2006 , and the area has now been redeveloped into a residential neighbourhood . The still existing Krechevitsy Airport does not serve any regular flights since mid-1990s although there is a plan to turn Krechevitsy into a new operational airport by 2025 . The nearest international airport is St . Petersburgs Pulkovo , some north of the city . Local transportation . Local transportation consists of a network of buses and trolleybuses . The trolleybus network , which currently consists of five routes , started operating in 1995 and is the first trolley system opened in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union . Honors . A minor planet , 3799 Novgorod , discovered by the Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979 , is named after the city . Twin towns – sister cities . Veliky Novgorod is twinned with : - Bielefeld , Germany - Kohtla-Järve , Estonia - Moss , Norway - Nanterre , France - Örebro , Sweden - Rochester , New York , US - Seinäjoki , Finland - Uusikaupunki , Finland - Watford , UK - Zibo , China</p><p>question: Veliky Novgorod was the capital of what from Jul 1930 to Jul 1944?</p><p>pred: </p><p>context_time: In 1727 , Novgorod was made the administrative center of Novgorod Governorate of the Russian Empire , which was detached from Saint Petersburg Governorate ( see Administrative divisions of Russia in 1727–1728 ) .

Anning is known for holding far-right , nativist , and anti-Muslim views , and has been criticised for his use of the Nazi euphemism for the Holocaust , when he proposed a plebiscite to be the Final Solution to the immigration problem in his maiden speech . Anning also generated controversy for his statements shortly after the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand , in which he blamed the attacks on the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate . Anning was elected to the Senate after a special recount was triggered by the removal of One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts . Anning chose not to join One Nation in the Senate , sitting instead as an independent until June 2018 , when he joined Katters Australian Party ( KAP ) as its first senator . Anning was expelled by Bob Katters Party in October 2018 for his views on race and immigration . Anning sat again as an independent , until registration of Fraser Annings Conservative National Party was granted in April 2019 . He failed to get re-elected to the Senate in the 2019 Federal Election , when standing under his own partys banner . White Rose Society and ABC News have detailed the white supremacist links of some of Annings closest advisers . His companions have included convicted criminals such as Neil Erikson and members of the militant white supremacist group True Blue Crew , whose members and supporters have been linked to right-wing terrorism . Anning was sought by creditors over unpaid debts in late 2019 , and declared bankruptcy on 16 March 2020 . Personal life and family history . Anning grew up in north-west Queensland on Wetherby Station , one of the Anning familys pastoral properties near the town of Richmond . He is a direct descendant of Charles Cumming Stone Anning , a pastoral squatter who immigrated to the Australian colonies in the mid-19th century to acquire landholdings . Charles and several of his sons established the Reedy Springs property north of Hughenden in 1862 , and soon expanded their claims by forming the nearby properties of Chudleigh Park , Mount Sturgeon , Charlotte Plains and Cargoon . In response to the spearing of their cattle by Aboriginal Australians , the Annings would ride out with firearms , attack Aboriginal campsites and capture young boys who survived in order to use them as labour on their cattle and sheep stations . The Annings at times also requested the services of the local Native Police paramilitary unit to assist in clearing blacks off their runs . Frank Hann , another pastoralist in the region who regularly participated in extrajudicial punitive raids on Aboriginals , described in his diary in 1874 that he saw Anning [ coming ] back from hunting blacks . Fraser Annings grandfather Francis Frank Albert Anning spent much of his time at Reedy Springs but also bought into further properties such as Wollogorang , Savannah Station and Compton Downs . One of Franks sons was W . H . ( Harry ) Anning who took up the Wetherby property and whose wife gave birth to Fraser Anning in October 1949 . He and his wife , Fiona , have two daughters . Anning is a Catholic , but not a regular churchgoer . Anning was declared bankrupt in 2020 , following the failure of a rental business , Gazelle Rentals . Bankruptcy . The Australian Federal Court handed down an order winding up the estate of William Fraser Anning on 16 March 2020 , as part of Annings ongoing dispute with Adelaide and Bendigo Bank , which was chasing the debt of $185,000 related to Mr Annings investment in a failed agribusiness scheme . The date of his bankruptcy was ordered to be set to 15 July 2019 . Sources close to Anning say he is currently visiting family in the United States and has not said when he will return to Australia . Political career . Anning holds strongly anti-abortion views . He opposes same-sex marriage and was one of twelve senators who voted against the Marriage Amendment ( Definition and Religious Freedoms ) Act 2017 , which made same-sex marriage legal in Australia . In 2017 , when Cory Bernardi moved a motion opposing Medicare funding of gender-selective abortion , Anning was one of ten senators who voted for the motion , which was defeated with 36 votes against . On 22 March 2018 Anning announced that he would support the Turnbull Governments proposed company tax cuts . Anning introduced a private members bill calling for less stringent import laws for mace , pepper spray and tasers , to allow women to defend themselves . It was supported by David Leyonhjelm , Peter Georgiou , Cory Bernardi and Brian Burston , but rejected by both major parties and the Greens . On 4 June 2018 Anning joined Katters Australian Party , becoming the partys first senator ; however , he was expelled in October 2018 for his inflammatory rhetoric concerning immigration . In 2018 Anning described the perpetrators of attacks on South African farms as subhuman , also claiming that a state-orchestrated genocide was underway in South Africa . Anning stated in a Senate speech that he believed Safe Schools was sexually deviant propaganda and undermined the white family . He criticised the curriculum as gender fluidity garbage . On 5 January 2019 Anning attended a far-right rally in Melbourne led by far-right extremist Blair Cottrell , founder of the United Patriots Front . In January 2019 he began the process with the Australian Electoral Commission ( AEC ) to register a new political party , called Fraser Annings Conservative National Party with a registered abbreviation of The Conservative Nationals . After the proposal to register that abbreviation was withdrawn , the AEC granted formal registration on 2 April 2019 . Zack Newton , an electoral officer on Senator Annings staff , was reported by the ABC as saying in early April 2019 that it was Amusing to think I went from shitposting at home and now Im shitposting in parliament , but here I am lmao , One Nation . In 1998 , he stood as a One Nation candidate for the lower house division of Fairfax at that years federal election . Anning was third on the One Nation senate ticket in Queensland at the 2016 federal election . He gained just 19 below-the-line first-preference votes under the optional preferential voting system . Due to its high statewide count , One Nation elected two senators in Queensland at the 2016 election – party leader Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts . In October 2017 , during the parliamentary eligibility crisis , the Court of Disputed Returns ruled Roberts was ineligible to be elected to the Senate due to his failure to renounce his British citizenship . The following month , on 10 November , Anning was declared elected in place of Roberts following a special recount . Prior to his elevation to the Senate , he was facing bankruptcy legal action due to money owed to the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank . This could have made him ineligible to sit in parliament , but the case was withdrawn . Upon his swearing in to the Senate on 13 November 2017 , Anning was vouched for ( a parliamentary custom indicating that the new member is who he claims to be ) by two crossbenchers from other parties : Cory Bernardi ( Australian Conservatives ) and David Leyonhjelm ( Liberal Democrats ) . Later on the same day , One Nation leader Pauline Hanson issued a media release saying that Anning had abandoned the party to sit as an independent until something else comes along . Anning responded that she [ Hanson ] made my position pretty much untenable with her conditions . On 16 November , it was reported that neither Anning nor Hanson had formally made their intentions clear to the Senate chamber regarding his party status , and he therefore remained a One Nation senator in the eyes of the Senate . It was also unclear whether Hanson intended to expel Anning solely from the parliamentary group or the wider organisational party as well . On 15 January 2018 , Anning advised the Senate President that he would henceforth sit as an independent . On 5 February 2018 , he formed a voting bloc with Bernardi and Leyonhjelm . Maiden speech . On 14 August 2018 Anning delivered his maiden speech to the Senate . In it , he called for a plebiscite to reintroduce the White Australia Policy , especially with regard to excluding Muslims . Anning went on to criticise the Safe Schools Coalition of Australia , as gender fluidity garbage and cultural Marxism . He also condemned what he described as the abuse of the external affairs power of the Australian constitution , and spoke in support of a fundamental right of civilians to own firearms , and the Bradfield Scheme irrigation proposal . His speech included a reference to a final solution—the phrase used by the Nazi Party to refer to the preparation and execution of the Holocaust , when he said The final solution to the immigration problem is , of course , a popular vote . Anning claimed that his comments were taken out of context , that he had used the phrase to introduce the last of six policies he proposed about immigration . His comments were condemned across the Parliament , including by the Labor Party , the Liberals , the Nationals , the Greens , Pauline Hansons One Nation and the Centre Alliance , among other crossbenchers in both the House of Representatives and the Senate . He has refused to apologise for his comments . Pauline Hanson said she was appalled by Annings comments and described them as straight from Goebbels handbook . However , Annings party leader Bob Katter described it as a magnificent speech , solid gold and said he 1000 percent supports Anning . However , Anning was expelled from Katters Australia Party two months later . Christchurch mosque shootings and egg incident . Anning was sharply criticised for his comments about the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand , in which 51 Muslim worshippers were killed . He claimed that immigration of Muslim fanatics led to the attacks , and that while Muslims may have been victims today , usually they are the perpetrators . Anning also stated that the massacre highlights...the growing fear within our community...of the increasing Muslim presence . The comments received international attention and were overwhelmingly criticised as being insensitive and racist , and sympathetic to the views of the perpetrator . As of 18 March 2019 , a petition calling for his expulsion from the Australian parliament had amassed 1.2 million signatures , although the ability for the Senate to expel a senator was removed with the passage of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 into law . On 16 March , Anning was struck by an egg on the back of his head by 17-year-old William Connolly while speaking to media and his supporters in a disused industrial warehouse in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin . Anning subsequently punched Connolly twice in the face . Connolly was then tackled by several of Annings supporters , including United Patriots Front leader Neil Erikson , one of whom held the youth in a choke hold until police arrived and took the teenager away . The teenager was taken into custody by police , but was released without charge , while they launched an investigation into the violence . On the day following the incident , Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison criticised Anning , arguing that the full force of the law should be applied to the senator . A fundraiser was started to support Connollys legal fees and to buy more eggs , claiming to have raised over $10,000 in under 24 hours . Connolly said he would give the money raised to the victims families . The money was held by a law firm acting without fee and on 27 May Connolly announced that a total of $99,922 had been donated to two funds providing for the victims of the Christchurch shooting . The police announced the completion of their investigation three weeks after the incident , saying that Anning would not be charged as his actions had been in self-defence , and that Connolly had received an official caution . However , a man who allegedly kicked Connolly several times while he was held down was charged with assault . Fraser Annings Conservative National Party . On 11 January 2019 , it was announced that Anning would form a party named Fraser Annings Conservative National Party . On 2 April 2019 , the party was registered by the Australian Electoral Commission . Anning said he would be announcing candidates across most lower house seats and running a Senate team in every state for the 2019 election . Two parties , the Australian Conservatives and The Nationals objected to the name , arguing it was too similar to theirs and would cause confusion for voters . However , the AEC said the use of Fraser and Anning in the partys name was sufficient to aurally and visually distinguish the partys name and abbreviation from other names and abbreviations on the ballot paper . There were similar objections to the request to adopt the abbreviation The Conservative Nationals . Registration was only granted following the withdrawal of that proposal . On 26 April 2019 , during the 2019 Federal Election campaign , Anning used the site of the 2005 Cronulla race riots in Sydney to announce his partys candidates for New South Wales . A 19-year-old supporter of Anning was arrested and charged with assault and intimidation after being involved in an altercation with members of the media immediately after the announcement , allegedly punching a photographer and abusing a journalist . Video footage shows the young man repeatedly punching the photographer , who sustained injury . The assailant was a member of the militant white supremacist group True Blue Crew , which has been linked to terrorism . Adrian David Cheok was a candidate for the Fraser Annings Conservative National Party and one of his strongest supporters . Anning lost his Senate seat in the 2019 election . The party was deregistered on 23 September 2020 . United States and post-political life . Following events which led to Anning being censured , and later losing his seat in the Australian senate , Anning moved to the United States of America . He created a new Facebook page , named Fraser Anning-Former Senator . In November 2020 , the Australian Electoral Commission ( AEC ) brought legal action against Anning , seeking a penalty of up to $26,640 for allegedly failing to lodge required financial returns for the 2018-19 financial year . On 16 February 2021 , the AEC dropped the case because they were unable to locate Anning in Australia despite several attempts to contact him , with the AEC believing him to be overseas .</p><p>question: Which party was Fraser Anning a member of from 1997 to 2018?</p><p>pred: One Nation</p><p>context_time: Anning was elected to the Senate after a special recount was triggered by the removal of One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts .

Morton played in over 500 games and scored over 119 goals in all competitions during his career and is perhaps best known for his spell at St Johnstone F.C . where he remains the clubs record top midfield goal scorer . Career . Jim Morton first moved into senior football when he was seventeen , signing for Brechin City F.C . from Dundee North End in 1974 . Throughout the next four years he established himself in the Brechin side . Several clubs had shown interest in the young Dundonian , but it was in August 1978 that Berwick Rangers F.C . came in to make a bid for the midfielder . A fee of £10,000 ( then a club record ) along with Billy Laing moving to Glebe Park was enough to bring Morton to Berwick . After a promising seasons start Berwick Rangers F.C . found themselves sitting off the pace at the top . It was then that the team and Morton recorded a run of seven consecutive wins . Morton scored six goals in four games and Rangers were safe . Morton was the seasons top scorer with nineteen goals . In November 1979 St Johnstone F.C . ( Saints ) came in with a £30,000 offer , thereby increasing his value threefold in the space of sixteen months . The figure equalled Saints record transfer fee paid . Nicknamed Silky at Muirton , Morton became one of the best midfielders ever to have played for the Saints . In 1981–82 he led the clubs scoring charts with another nineteen goal haul . He remains to this day the clubs record goal scoring midfielder . After Saints were relegated from the Premier league , Morton accepted an offer from Brisbane Lions , Queensland and left for Australia in 1986 . He returned to Scotland late in 1987 and instead of going to Saints he signed for Forfar Athletic F.C . usually playing in his familiar midfield role , but occasionally appearing in the no 3 shirt . Morton played his 100th league encounter in Forfar colours . After three years at Station Park he opened the final chapter in his playing career when he moved along the road to Arbroath . Mortons final season as senior was 92/93 and decided to retire from the game completely and concentrate on a career in banking . Despite spending part of his career abroad , Morton still managed over 500 league appearances netting in excess of 100 goals . Currently residing in East Yorkshire , England .

In 1967 , she caused an international furor when she defected to the United States and , in 1978 , became a naturalized citizen . From 1984 to 1986 , she briefly returned to the Soviet Union and had her Soviet citizenship reinstated . She was Stalins last surviving child . Early life . Svetlana Alliluyeva was born on 28 February 1926 . As her mother was interested in pursuing a professional career , a nanny , Alexandra Bychokova , was hired to look after Alliluyeva and her older brother Vasily ( born 1921 ) . Alliluyeva and Bychokova became quite close , and remained friends for 30 years , until Bychokova died in 1956 . On 9 November 1932 Alliluyevas mother shot herself . To conceal the suicide , the children were told that she had died of peritonitis , a complication from appendicitis . It would be 10 years before they learned the truth of their mothers death . On 15 August 1942 , Winston Churchill saw Alliluyeva in Stalins private apartments at the Kremlin , describing her as a handsome red-haired girl , who kissed her father dutifully . Churchill says Stalin looked at me with a twinkle in his eye as if , so I thought , to convey You see , even we Bolsheviks have a family life . At the age of sixteen , Alliluyeva fell in love with Aleksei Kapler , a Jewish Soviet filmmaker who was 38 years old . Her father vehemently disapproved of the relationship and Kapler was sentenced to five years of exile in 1943 to Vorkuta and was then sentenced again in 1948 to five years in labor camps near Inta . Marriages . Alliluyeva was first married in 1944 to Grigory Morozov , a student at Moscow Universitys Institute of International Affairs . Her father did not like Morozov , who was Jewish , though he never met him . They had one child , a son Iosif , who was born in 1945 . The couple divorced in 1947 due to personal reasons , but remained close friends for decades afterwards . Alliluyevas second marriage was arranged for her to Yuri Zhdanov , the son of Stalins right-hand man Andrei Zhdanov and himself one of Stalins close associates . The couple married early in 1949 . Alliluyeva lived with Zhdanovs family at this time , though felt herself dominated by his mother , Zinaida , which was something Stalin had warned her of . Yuri was devoted to Zinaida , and busied himself with Party work , so did not spend a lot of time with Alliluyeva . In 1950 , Alliluyeva gave birth to a daughter , Yekaterina . The marriage was dissolved soon afterwards . In 1962 she married Ivan Svanidze , the nephew of Stalins first wife , Kato Svanidze , soon after meeting him for the first time since his parents arrest in 1937 . They went against Soviet policy by marrying in a church . Svanidze was not healthy , owing to difficulties of his internal exile in Kazakhstan , and the marriage ended within a year . From 1970 to 1973 , she was married to American architect William Wesley Peters ( an acolyte of Frank Lloyd Wright ) , with whom she had a daughter , Olga Peters ( later known also as Chrese Evans ) . After the death of Stalin . After her fathers death in 1953 , Alliluyeva worked as a lecturer and translator in Moscow . Her training was in History and Political Thought , a subject she was forced to study by her father , although her true passion was literature and writing . In a 2010 interview , she stated that his refusal to let her study arts and his treatment of Kapler were the two times that Stalin broke my life , and that the latter loved her but was a very simple man . Very rude . Very cruel . When asked at a New York conference about whether she agreed with her fathers rule , she said that she was disapproving of a lot of his decisions but also noted that the responsibility for them also lay with the Communist regime in general . Relationship with Brajesh Singh . In 1963 , while in hospital for a tonsillectomy , Alliluyeva met Kunwar Brajesh Singh , an Indian Communist from the Kalakankar Rajput Zamindar family visiting Moscow . The two fell in love . Singh was mild-mannered and well-educated but gravely ill with bronchiectasis and emphysema . The romance grew deeper and stronger still while the couple were recuperating in Sochi near the Black Sea . Singh returned to Moscow in 1965 to work as a translator , but he and Alliluyeva were not allowed to marry . He died the following year , in 1966 . She was allowed to travel to India to take his ashes to his family to pour into the Ganges river . In an interview on 26 April 1967 , she referred to Singh as her husband but also stated that they were never allowed to marry officially . Political asylum and later life . On 9 March 1967 , Alliluyeva approached the United States Embassy in New Delhi . After she stated her desire to defect in writing , the United States Ambassador Chester Bowles offered her political asylum and a new life in the United States . Alliluyeva accepted . The Indian government feared condemnation by the Soviet Union , so she was immediately sent from India to Rome . When the Qantas flight arrived in Rome , Alliluyeva immediately travelled farther to Geneva , Switzerland , where the government arranged her a tourist visa and accommodation for six weeks . She travelled to the United States , leaving her adult children in the USSR . Upon her arrival in New York City in April 1967 , she gave a press conference denouncing her fathers legacy and the Soviet government . After living for several months in Mill Neck , Long Island under Secret Service protection , Alliluyeva moved to Princeton , New Jersey , where she lectured and wrote , later moving to Pennington . In a 2010 interview , she described herself as quite happy here [ Wisconsin ] . Her children who were left behind in the Soviet Union did not maintain contact with her . While Western sources saw a KGB hand behind this , her children claimed that this is because of her complex character . In 1983 , after the Soviet government had stopped blocking Alliluyevas attempts to communicate with her USSR-based children , her son Iosif began to call her regularly and planned to visit her in England , but was refused permission to travel by the Soviet authorities . She did experiment with various religions . While some claim she had money problems , others argue that her financial situation was good , because of her great popularity . For example , her first book , Twenty Letters to a Friend , caused a worldwide sensation and brought her , some estimate , about $2,500,000 . Alliluyeva herself stated that she gave away much of her book proceeds to charity and by around 1986 had become impoverished , facing debt and failed investments . In 1970 , Alliluyeva answered an invitation from Frank Lloyd Wrights widow , Olgivanna Lloyd Wright , to visit Wrights winter studio , Taliesin West , in Scottsdale , Arizona . In 1978 , Alliluyeva became a US citizen , and in 1982 , she moved with her daughter to Cambridge in England , where they shared an apartment near the Cambridge University Botanic Garden . In 1984 , during a time where Stalins legacy saw partial rehabilitation in the Soviet Union , she moved back together with her daughter Olga , and both were given Soviet citizenship . The British journalist Miriam Gross with whom Svetlana conducted her final interview before moving back from England to the Soviet Union in 1984 , described Svetlanas increasingly fragile state of mind in a series of letters she wrote to Gross following the interview : In 1986 , she again moved back from Russia to the U.S . with Olga , and after her return denied anti-Western comments she had made while back in the USSR ( including that she had not enjoyed one single day of freedom in the West and had been a pet of the CIA ) . Alliluyeva , for the most part , lived the last two years of her life in southern Wisconsin , either in Richland Center or in Spring Green , the location of Wrights summer studio Taliesin . She died on 22 November 2011 from complications arising from colon cancer in Richland Center , where she had spent time while visiting from Cambridge . At the time of Alliluyevas death , her youngest daughter , Olga , went by the name Chrese Evans and ran a fashion boutique in Portland , Oregon . Yekaterina , a geologist , was living in Siberias Kamchatka Peninsula studying a volcano . Her son Iosif , a cardiologist , had died in Russia in 2008 . Religion . Alliluyeva was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church on 20 March 1963 . During her years of exile , she flirted with various religions . She then turned to the Orthodox Church and is also reported to have thought of becoming a nun . In 1967 , Alliluyeva found herself spending time with Roman Catholics in Switzerland and encountered many denominations during her time in the US . She received a letter from Father Garbolino , an Italian Catholic priest from Pennsylvania , inviting her to make a pilgrimage to Fátima , in Portugal , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the famous apparitions there . In 1969 , Garbolino , who was in New Jersey , came to visit Alliluyeva at Princeton . In California , she lived with a Catholic couple , Michael and Rose Ginciracusa , for two years ( 1976–78 ) . She read books by authors such as Raissa Maritain . In Cambridge , in December 1982 , on the feast of Santa Lucia , Advent , Alliluyeva converted to the Roman Catholic Church . Works . While in the Soviet Union , Alliluyeva had written a memoir in Russian in 1963 . The manuscript was carried safely out of the country by Ambassador T . N . Kaul , who returned it to her in New Delhi . Alliluyeva handed her memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle at the time of her own defection . Rayle made a copy of it . The book was titled Twenty Letters to a Friend ( Dvadtsat pisem k drugu ) . It was the only thing other than a few items of clothing taken by Alliluyeva on a secret passenger flight out of India . Raymond Pearson , in Russia and Eastern Europe , described Alliluyevas book as a naïve attempt to shift the blame for Stalinist crimes onto Lavrentiy Beria , and whitewash her own father . In popular culture . Alliluyeva was portrayed by Joanna Roth in the HBOs 1992 television film Stalin and Andrea Riseborough in the 2017 satirical film The Death of Stalin . Alliluyeva is the subject of the 2019 novel The Red Daughter by American writer John Burnham Schwartz .</p><p>question: Who was the spouse of Svetlana Alliluyeva from 1970 to 1973?</p><p>pred: William Wesley Peters</p><p>context_time: From 1970 to 1973 , she was married to American architect William Wesley Peters ( an acolyte of Frank Lloyd Wright ) , with whom she had a daughter , Olga Peters ( later known also as Chrese Evans ) .

Design and construction . Acme was an Emergency Fleet Corporation design 1047 tanker laid down by the Union Iron Works in San Francisco , in 1916 , for the United States Shipping Board . She was launched 29 April 1916 , and commissioned 22 June 1916 . Acme was designed for transporting oil in bulk to Far Eastern ports that had been served by British ships before the outbreak of World War I . She , along with four more ships that were to follow her , had been designated A boats by the Marine Transportation Department . Service history . World War I . During World War I Acme filled in for British ship that had been commandeered by the British Admiralty . Her first voyage was to China . She would continue her San Francisco to China route for the next five years with only rare trips to New York for loads to Singapore via the Suez Canal . After the United States entered World War I , only Acme and two of her sister ships were available for Standard Transportation to use in the Pacific , this was mainly because on her return trips she would load coconut oil in the Philippines , which because of its 12 percent glycerin content made it a valuable war cargo . Post war service . Acme started running a route from the Texas-oil-coast to ports-north-of-Hatteras in 1925 . She changed owners in 1931 and 1935 , but she didnt change names . World War II .

His opinion on the role of Britain in Ireland and in Northern Ireland changed during the 1970s , in response to the outbreak of The Troubles . He saw opposing nationalist and unionist traditions as irreconcilable and switched from a nationalist to a unionist view of Irish politics and history . Cruise OBriens outlook was always radical and the positions he took were seldom orthodox . He summarised his position as intending to administer an electric shock to the Irish psyche . Internationally , while he was a long-standing member of the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement , he opposed in person the African National Congresss academic boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa . These views contrasted with those he espoused during the 1950s and 1960s . During his career as a civil servant , Cruise OBrien worked on the governments anti-partition campaign . At the 1969 general election , he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin North-East , and served as a Minister between 1973 and 1977 . He was also the Labour Partys Spokesman on Northern Ireland during those years . He was later known primarily as an author and as an Irish Independent and Sunday Independent columnist . Early life . Donal Conor David Dermot Donat Cruise OBrien was born at 44 Leinster Road , Rathmines , Dublin , to Francis ( Frank ) Cruise OBrien and Kathleen Sheehy . Frank was a journalist with the Freemans Journal and Irish Independent newspapers , and had edited an essay written 50 years earlier by William Lecky concerning the influence of the clergy on Irish politics . Kathleen was an Irish language teacher . She was the daughter of David Sheehy , a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party and organiser of the Irish National Land League . She had three sisters , Hanna , Margaret and Mary . Hannas husband , the well-known pacifist and supporter of womens suffrage Francis Sheehy-Skeffington , was executed by firing squad on the orders of Captain J.C Bowen Colthurst during the 1916 Easter Rising . Soon afterwards Marys husband , Thomas Kettle , an officer of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers in the First WOrld War , was killed during the Battle of the Somme . These women , Hanna and Kathleen in particular , were a major influence on Cruise OBriens upbringing alongside Hannas son , Owen Sheehy-Skeffington . Cruise OBriens father ( who died in 1927 ) wanted Conor educated non-denominationally ; Kathleen honoured that wish . Cruise OBrien followed his cousin Owen into Sandford Park School that had a predominantly Protestant ethos , despite objections from Catholic clergy . Cruise OBrien subsequently attended Trinity College Dublin , which played the British national anthem until 1939 . While others stood , Cruise OBrien and Sheehy-Skeffington sat in protest on such occasions . Cruise OBrien was elected a scholar in Modern Languages at Trinity in 1937 and was editor of Trinitys weekly , . His first wife , Christine Foster , came from a Belfast Presbyterian family and was , like her father , a member of the Gaelic League . Her parents , Alexander ( Alec ) Roulston Foster and Anne ( Annie ) Lynd , were in Cruise O’Brien’s description , Home Rulers ; a very advanced position for any Protestants in the period . Alec Foster was at the time headmaster of Belfast Royal Academy ; he was later a founding member of the Wolfe Tone Society , and was a strong supporter of the Irish Anti-Apartheid movement . He was a former Ulster , Ireland and British &amp; Irish Lions rugby player , having captained Ireland three times between 1912 and 1914 . Cruise OBrien and Christine Foster were married in a registry office in 1939 . The couple had three children : Donal , Fedelma , and Kathleen ( Kate ) , who died in 1998 . The marriage ended in divorce after 20 years . In 1962 , Cruise OBrien married the Irish-language writer and poet Máire Mhac an tSaoi in a Roman Catholic church . Cruise OBriens divorce , though contrary to Roman Catholic teaching , was not an issue because that church did not recognise the validity of Cruise OBriens 1939 civil wedding . Cruise OBrien referred to this action , which in effect formally de-recognised the legitimacy of his former wife and children , as hypocritical … and otherwise distasteful , but I took it , as preferable to the alternatives . Mac an tSaoi was five years his junior , and the daughter of Seán MacEntee , who was Tánaiste ( deputy prime minister ) at the time . They subsequently adopted two children of Irish-African parentage , a son ( Patrick ) and a daughter ( Margaret ) . Cruise OBriens university education led to a career in the public service , most notably in the Department of External Affairs . He achieved distinction as managing director of the state-run Irish News Agency and later as part of the fledgling Irish delegation to the United Nations . Cruise OBrien later claimed he was something of an anomalous iconoclast in post-1922 Irish politics , particularly in the context of Fianna Fáil governments under Éamon de Valera . Cruise OBrien wrote that the then Secretary of the Department , Joseph P . Walshe , might well have considered that Cruise O’Brien was no fit person to be a member of Catholic Irelands Department of External Affairs . Cruise O’Brien attributed his appointment to a decision taken at a higher level . Under God , there was only one higher level . This consisted of Eamon de Valera , then Minister for External Affairs as well as Taoiseach . Cruise O’Brien speculated that de Valeras Catholicism may have been conditioned by his excommunication during the Civil War of 1922/3 , that he may have felt that Walshe had been too close to the previous government and that he may have been conscious of the nationalist credentials of the Sheehy family , notably Cruise O’Briens great uncle , Father Eugene Sheehy , who had been parish priest of Bruree during de Valera’s formative years . De Valera later wrote of Father Sheehy , ( It was he who taught me patriotism ) . Cruise OBrien wrote of his entry into the public service The time when I joined the Department of Finance was the first time , since my First Communion , that I found myself in a working environment which was mainly – indeed almost entirely - Catholic . As he admitted , his non-belief did not impede his career , which ended at ambassadorial level . He observed , In the Department of External Affairs , during the 1948–51 inter-party government , Cruise OBrien served under Seán MacBride , son of John MacBride and Maud Gonne , republican and former IRA Chief of Staff , who would become the 1974 Nobel Peace Laureate . Cruise OBrien was particularly vocal in opposition to partition during the 1940s and 1950s , as part of his official duties . International posting . Cruise OBrien came to prominence in 1961 , after his secondment from Irelands UN delegation as a special representative to Dag Hammarskjöld , Secretary General of the United Nations , in the Katanga region of the newly independent Congo ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) . OBrien accused a combination of British , French and white Rhodesian elements of attempting to partition off Katanga as a pro-western client-state . He used military force to oppose a combination of western mercenaries and Katangan forces . A UN crisis ensued and Cruise OBrien was forced to step down simultaneously from his UN position and the Irish diplomatic service in late 1961 . He went public immediately with his version of events , writing simultaneously in the Observer ( London ) and the New York Times that , My resignation from the United Nations and from the Irish foreign service is a result of British government policy . Michael Ignatieff asserted that Hammarskjöld , who was killed in Katanga in a suspicious plane crash prior to OBriens departure , had misjudged OBriens abilities as UN representative . He further observed that OBriens use of military force provided the Soviets and the US with ammunition in their campaign against the UN Secretary General and against UN actions in opposition to the interests of the big powers . That thesis was later shown to be inaccurate by the documentary CONGO 1961 , which showed that Hammarskjöld himself had ordered the military actions and left Cruise OBrien to take the blame when they failed . Documents on Irish Foreign Policy 1957-1961 ( 2018 ) , included 1961 correspondence in which Frederick Boland , Irelands ambassador to the UN , said that he had been told by Ralph Bunche , Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for special political affairs , that Cruise OBrien had been given the green light for the seizure of the Post Office and the Radio Station . Siege of Jadotville . In September 1961 , a company of 157 Irish UN troops was surrounded by a force of heavily armed Gendarmerie and mercenaries outnumbering them 20-to-one in the jungle of Central Africa . The Irish soldiers , many of them still in their teens , were lightly armed , short of ammunition and supplies and unprepared for the situation . They had been sent to the newly independent Republic of Congo on what was supposed to be a peacekeeping mission but were ordered on to the offensive by the UNs most senior diplomat on the ground , Cruise OBrien acting on the instructions of the Secretary General , who wanted the Katanga problem solved before the upcoming United Nations General Assembly , as his career was on the line . The Irish troops held out for six days before they ran out of bullets and drinking water . When water finally reached them , it came in old petrol cans that had not been cleaned , making it undrinkable . The troops inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy force but suffered no fatalities themselves . After their surrender , they spent just over one month in captivity unsure of their fate , and when they arrived back in Ireland , they were dismayed and deeply hurt to learn that the UN and their own government were anxious to sweep the episode under the carpet to protect the reputation and to conceal the failures of the UN in preparing for combat and liberating Company A . Cruise OBrien wrote immediately about his experiences in The Observer ( London ) and in The New York Times on 10 and 17 December 1961 . Cruise OBriens version of events , set out in his 1962 book To Katanga and Back , has been dismissed as highly selective and self-serving , and it deliberately excluded crucial items . However recent evidence from the UN archives suggests Cruise OBrien had acted with the express approval of Hammarskjöld . Armed with the archive material , one expert concluded Hammarskjöld knew in advance that the UN was about to take action in Katanga and he authorised that action . A film based on the events , The Siege of Jadotville , depicts Cruise OBrien as pitying but ultimately unregretful for the fate of the inexperienced Irish troops isolated in Jadotville as a result of his own instructions . A documentary , CONGO 1961 , made for Irish television station TG4 challenged that by showing that the actions for which Cruise OBrien was blamed had been ordered by Hammarskjöld and later covered up by the UN to make Cruise OBrien the scapegoat . Academic positions 1960s . After OBrien was recalled from UN service and his resignation from the Irish civil service , he served as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ghana . He resigned after he fell out with the Chancellor and President of Ghana , Kwame Nkrumah , in 1965 . OBrien was then appointed Albert Schweitzer Professor of humanities in New York University , a position he held until 1969 . During the 1960s OBrien was an active opponent of US involvement in Vietnam . He supported the right of Vietnamese people to use violence against US armed forces . At a 1967 Vietnam War symposium O’Brien clashed with Hannah Arendt , who had remarked , As to the Viet Cong terror , we cannot possibly agree with it . O’Brien responded , I think there is a distinction between the use of terror by oppressed peoples against the oppressors and their servants , in comparison with the use of terror by their oppressors in the interests of further oppression . I think there is a qualitative distinction there which we have the right to make . In December 1967 O’Brien was front-page news in the Irish Times , that reported his arrest while demonstrating against the war , and being kicked by a policeman . In May 1968 O’Brien condemned police attacks on , and harassment of , the militant , armed , Black Panther Party . Irish politics . Cruise OBrien returned to Ireland and in the 1969 general election was elected to Dáil Éireann as a member of the opposition Labour Party in the four-seat Dublin North-East constituency , alongside Charles Haughey , whose probity in financial matters he questioned . He was appointed a member of the short-lived first delegation from the Oireachtas to the European Parliament . After the 1973 general election , Cruise OBrien was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the 1973–77 Labour-Fine Gael coalition under Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave . After the outbreak of armed conflict in Northern Ireland in 1969 , Cruise OBrien developed a deep hostility to militant Irish republicanism and to Irish nationalists generally in Northern Ireland , which reversed the views that he articulated at the outset of the unrest . He also reversed his opposition to broadcasting censorship imposed by the previous government , by extending and vigorously enforcing censorship of Raidió Teilifís Éireann ( RTÉ ) under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act . In 1976 , he specifically banned spokespersons for Sinn Féin and the Provisional Irish Republican Army from RTÉ . At the same time , he unsuccessfully attempted to have Britains BBC 1 broadcast on Irelands proposed second television channel , instead of allowing RTÉ to run it . Two additional notable incidents affected Cruise OBriens career as minister , besides his support for broadcasting censorship . In August 1976 , Bernard Nossiter of The Washington Post interviewed him on the passage of an Emergency Powers Bill . During the course of the interview , Cruise OBrien revealed an intention to extend censorship beyond broadcasting . He wished to cleanse the culture of republicanism and said that he would like the bill to be used against teachers who allegedly glorified Irish revolutionaries . He also wanted it used against newspaper editors who published pro-republican or anti-British readers letters . Cruise OBrien mentioned The Irish Press as a newspaper against which he particularly hoped to use the legislation against and produced a file of Irish Press letters to the editor to which he took exception . Nossiter immediately informed The Irish Press editor Tim Pat Coogan of Cruise OBriens intentions . Coogan printed Nossiters report ( as did The Irish Times ) , republished the letters to which Cruise OBrien objected and ran a number of strong editorials attacking Cruise OBrien and the proposed legislation . The interview caused huge controversy and resulted in the modification of the measure appearing to target newspapers . Cruise OBrien also supported Garda Síochána brutality from 1973 to 1977 , but that was not revealed by Cruise OBrien until 1998 in his Memoir . In Memoir : My Life and Themes , Cruise OBrien recalled a conversation with a detective who told him how the Gardaí had found out from a suspect the location of businessman Tiede Herrema , who had been kidnapped by group of maverick republicans in October 1975 : the escort started asking him questions and when at first he refused to answer , they beat the shit out of him . Then he told them where Herrema was./ Cruise OBrien explained , I refrained from telling this story to [ ministerial colleagues ] Garret [ FitzGerald ] or Justin [ Keating ] , because I thought it would worry them . It didnt worry me . Elements of the Garda that engaged in beating false confessions out of suspects quickly became known as the Heavy Gang . Cruise OBriens Dublin North-East constituency was re-drawn and re-named as part of his Labour colleague James Tullys attempt as Minister for Local Government to design boundaries in the electoral interests of the coalition partners . The plan backfired . In the 1977 general election , he stood in Dublin Clontarf and was one of three ministers ( the others being Justin Keating and Patrick Cooney ) defeated in a rout of the outgoing administration . He was , however , subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann in 1977 from the Trinity College Dublin constituency . He was dropped as Labours Northern Ireland spokesperson . OBrien resigned his seat in 1979 because of new commitments as editor-in-chief of The Observer newspaper in London . Editor-in-Chief at The Observer . Between 1978 and 1981 Cruise OBrien was editor-in-chief of The Observer newspaper in Britain . In 1979 he controversially refused to publish an Observer article by Mary Holland , the papers Ireland correspondent . Holland , whose reporting won her a Journalist of the Year award , had been one of the first journalists to explain discrimination in Northern Ireland to a British audience . The article was a profile of Mary Nelis of Derry and dealt with her radicalisation as a result of the conflict . Cruise OBrien objected and sent Holland a memo stating that the killing strain of Irish republicanism has a very high propensity to run in families and the mother is most often the carrier . The memo continued , It is a very serious weakness of your coverage of Irish affairs that you are a very poor judge of Irish Catholics . That gifted and talkative community includes some of the most expert conmen and conwomen in the world and I believe you have been conned . Holland was forced out of the newspaper by Cruise OBrien . She later joined The Irish Times as a columnist . She also rejoined The Observer after Cruise OBriens departure in 1981 . Unionism . In 1985 , Cruise OBrien supported unionist objections to the inter-governmental Anglo-Irish Agreement . In 1996 he joined Robert McCartneys United Kingdom Unionist Party ( UKUP ) and was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum . In 1997 , a successful libel action was brought against him by relatives of Bloody Sunday victims for alleging in a Sunday Independent article in 1997 that the marchers were Sinn Féin activists operating for the IRA . Cruise OBrien opposed the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and opposed allowing Sinn Féin into government in Northern Ireland . He wrote that he was glad to be an ally … in defence of the Union with the Reverend Ian Paisley , leader of the Free Presbyterian Church and of the Democratic Unionist Party . In 1968 OBrien had referred to Paisley as a hate merchant . He also predicted , mistakenly , that Paisley would not enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin . OBrien later resigned from the UKUP after his book Memoir : My Life and Themes called on Unionists to consider the benefits of a united Ireland in order to thwart Sinn Féin . In 2005 he rejoined the Irish Labour Party . Cruise OBrien defended his harsh attitudes and actions towards Irish republicans , saying We do right to condemn all violence but we have a special duty to condemn the violence which is committed in our name .

Cruise OBriens many books include : States of Ireland ( 1972 ) , where he first indicated his revised view of Irish nationalism , The Great Melody ( 1992 ) , his thematic biography of Edmund Burke , and his autobiography Memoir : My Life and Themes ( 1999 ) . He also published a collection of essays , Passion and Cunning ( 1988 ) , which includes a substantial piece on the literary work of William Butler Yeats and some challenging views on the subject of terrorism , and ( 1986 ) , a history of Zionism and the State of Israel . His books , particularly those on Irish issues , tend to be personalised , for example States of Ireland , where he made the link between the political success of the republican Easter Rising and the consequent demise of his Home Rule familys position in society . His private papers have been deposited in the University College Dublin Archives . In 1963 , Cruise OBriens script for a Telefís Éireann programme on Charles Stewart Parnell won him a Jacobs Award . He was a longtime columnist for the Irish Independent . His articles were distinguished by hostility to the Northern Ireland peace process , regular predictions of civil war involving the Republic of Ireland , and a pro-Unionist stance . Cruise OBrien held visiting professorships and lectureships throughout the world , particularly in the United States , and controversially in apartheid South Africa , openly breaking the academic boycott . A persistent critic of Charles Haughey , Cruise OBrien coined the acronym GUBU ( Grotesque , Unbelievable , Bizarre and Unprecedented ) , based on a statement by Charles Haughey , who was then Taoiseach , commenting on the discovery of a murder suspect , Malcolm MacArthur , in the apartment of the Fianna Fáil Attorney General Patrick Connolly . Until 1994 , Cruise OBrien was a Pro-Chancellor of the University of Dublin . According to Roy Foster , Colm Tóibín wrote that Seamus Heaney was so popular that he could even survive being endorsed by Conor Cruise O’Brien , which normally meant the kiss of death in Ireland . The legendary The New Yorker fact-checking desk , unable to let a single statement go uncorroborated , found out Cruise O’Brien’s Dublin phone number and rang to inquire if his approval meant the kiss of death in his native country : they then telephoned an astonished Tóibín and reproachfully told him : Mr OBrien said : No , it didnt .

During his career as a civil servant , Cruise OBrien worked on the governments anti-partition campaign . At the 1969 general election , he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin North-East , and served as a Minister between 1973 and 1977 . He was also the Labour Partys Spokesman on Northern Ireland during those years . He was later known primarily as an author and as an Irish Independent and Sunday Independent columnist . Cruise OBrien also supported Garda Síochána brutality from 1973 to 1977 , but that was not revealed by Cruise OBrien until 1998 in his Memoir . In Memoir : My Life and Themes , Cruise OBrien recalled a conversation with a detective who told him how the Gardaí had found out from a suspect the location of businessman Tiede Herrema , who had been kidnapped by group of maverick republicans in October 1975 : the escort started asking him questions and when at first he refused to answer , they beat the shit out of him . Then he told them where Herrema was./ Cruise OBrien explained , I refrained from telling this story to [ ministerial colleagues ] Garret [ FitzGerald ] or Justin [ Keating ] , because I thought it would worry them . It didnt worry me . Elements of the Garda that engaged in beating false confessions out of suspects quickly became known as the Heavy Gang . Cruise OBriens Dublin North-East constituency was re-drawn and re-named as part of his Labour colleague James Tullys attempt as Minister for Local Government to design boundaries in the electoral interests of the coalition partners . The plan backfired . In the 1977 general election , he stood in Dublin Clontarf and was one of three ministers ( the others being Justin Keating and Patrick Cooney ) defeated in a rout of the outgoing administration . He was , however , subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann in 1977 from the Trinity College Dublin constituency . He was dropped as Labours Northern Ireland spokesperson . OBrien resigned his seat in 1979 because of new commitments as editor-in-chief of The Observer newspaper in London . Between 1978 and 1981 Cruise OBrien was editor-in-chief of The Observer newspaper in Britain . In 1979 he controversially refused to publish an Observer article by Mary Holland , the papers Ireland correspondent . Holland , whose reporting won her a Journalist of the Year award , had been one of the first journalists to explain discrimination in Northern Ireland to a British audience . The article was a profile of Mary Nelis of Derry and dealt with her radicalisation as a result of the conflict . Cruise OBrien objected and sent Holland a memo stating that the killing strain of Irish republicanism has a very high propensity to run in families and the mother is most often the carrier . The memo continued , It is a very serious weakness of your coverage of Irish affairs that you are a very poor judge of Irish Catholics . That gifted and talkative community includes some of the most expert conmen and conwomen in the world and I believe you have been conned . Holland was forced out of the newspaper by Cruise OBrien . She later joined The Irish Times as a columnist . She also rejoined The Observer after Cruise OBriens departure in 1981 .</p><p>pred_time: Seanad Éireann</p><p>groundtruth: </p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-243"/wiki/Izod#P1448#1</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Izod#P1448#1<p>context: Izod The Izod Corporation ( officially stylized as IZOD ) is an American mid-range clothing company that produces dressy-casual clothing , sportswear for men , as well as footwear and accessories . It is part of PVH , forming part of its Heritage Brands division along with Van Heusen , Arrow , Warners , Olga , True &amp; Co. , and Geoffrey Beene . It is perhaps best known for its short-sleeved piqué polo shirt , formerly produced by Lacoste and featuring the Lacoste crocodile on the left breast , now replaced with an embroidered ( or screen-printed on some golfwear ) crest . One variation is the IZ patch instead of crest . Other Izod classics include the Harrington jacket G-9 model , also v-neck and cardigan sweaters . Today , the Izod brand competes most directly with the similarly-priced Chaps brand owned by Ralph Lauren Corporation , while competing more indirectly on the lower end with U.S . Polo Assn . and on the higher end with Nautica . Of PVHs two preppy-styled brands , Izod is the lower-priced of the two , slotting below Tommy Hilfiger in the lineup , and is considered a companion to PVHs Van Heusen brand , which is more focused on dresswear and business casual clothing . History . In the late 1930s , Vincent dePaul Draddy , an American businessman employed by David Crystal Co. , needed a strong name to associate with his quality merchandise for menswear . While vacationing with his family in London , he encountered Jack Izods tailoring boutique . Izod ( himself a well-respected tailor ) produced bespoke shirts and created the Windsor tie-knot for King George V , but was ready to retire , and accepted Draddys offer to purchase the rights to his distinctive name . The A.J . Izod of London clothing company was introduced to the United States in 1938 . Izod Lacoste . Izod of London would become most notable for its pairing with the Lacoste shirt company from 1952 to 1993 . Vincent Draddy began to license the Lacoste shirt to add prestige to the Izod line , but he could not find a market for the then-expensive $8.00 retail price ( approximately ) . After Draddy began giving the shirts away to his famous friends , Dwight D . Eisenhower , Bing Crosby , Daniel Platt , and John F . Kennedy , the shirts soon became popular with department stores . Izod of London became a brand known simply as Izod Lacoste . While the shirts were equally Izod and Lacoste , they became abbreviated and popularized as Izod shirts ( which led to the ongoing misunderstanding that the famous Crocodile is the Izod trademark ) . Growth . In 1964 , Bernard Lacoste took over the management of the company . Significant company growth was seen under Bernards management . When he became president , around 300,000 Izod Lacoste products were sold annually . The Izod Lacoste brand reached its height of popularity in the US during the late 1970s and became the signature 1980s preppy wardrobe item , mentioned in The Official Preppy Handbook . The company also began to introduce other products into their line including shorts , perfume , optical and sunglasses , tennis shoes , deck shoes , walking shoes , watches , and various leather goods . In 1977 , Le Tigre Clothing was founded in an attempt to directly compete with Izod Lacoste in the US market , selling a similar array of apparel , but featuring a tiger in place of the signature Lacoste crocodile . Also , during this period Izods parent , Crystal Brands , came under the management of General Mills , and purchased the Gant U.S.A . brand . Separation . During the early 1990s , Izod Lacoste struggled to maintain the market dominance it had enjoyed in previous decades . The initial reaction from Crystal Brands was to separate the two names and target two groups of customers at once ; Izod was re-introduced as moderate pricepoint apparel in department stores , while Lacoste was renamed Lacoste Chemise , and re-positioned as a luxury lifestyle brand . Eventually , this tactic did not provide the financial gain Crystal had hoped and the license partnering ended in 1993 . Sportloisirs S.A . purchased the Lacoste brand entirely in 1993 , while Izod was sold to Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation in 1995 . PVH repositioned and restored some of Izods previous relevance while introducing a number of product lines and brands , complete with an Izod crest logo , or patch . In addition to its sportswear , Izod designs a full range of mens suits , shirts , neckties , shoes , outerwear and fragrances , and continues to produce its famous polo shirts . Currently , within the PVH corp . the Izod branded shirt has become part of the biggest shirt company in the United States . Recent history . From 2003 to 2007 , PVH formed a licensing deal with Kellwood Company to produce Izod-branded womens clothing . Production of the womens line was brought in-house in 2007 until its discontinuation in 2015 . On January 7 , 2015 parent company Phillips-Van Heusen announced that it would be closing all 120 Izod retail outlets due to an increasingly competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel . This move will not affect Izods growing wholesale business to department stores and other retailers . Coinciding with the closure of the retail outlets , in 2015 the womens line was discontinued . In Spring 2016 , Izod introduced the Advantage Polo , a new take on their traditional piqué polo featuring a cotton/polyester blend with natural stretch , moisture-wicking fabric , and UPF-15 sun protection . The Advantage Polo remains available today with various colors and patterns being offered depending on seasonal collection , with the core year-round colors as of 2021 being black , white , bright red , azure , and navy ( with pale pink , turquoise , cobalt blue , bright purple , lemon yellow , orange , wine red , and olive green available as additional year-round Amazon-exclusive colors ) and now outsells Izods original 100% cotton Heritage piqué polo . The original cotton Heritage piqué polo remains available for purchase online on Amazon , but has not seen any styling updates since 2016 . The Advantage brand was later expanded to include other products with stretch and/or moisture-wicking fabric such as fleece sweatshirts and button-down shirts . On June 7 , 2017 , parent company PVH announced that it has reached a licensing agreement with Adjmi Apparel Group subsidiary Sports Products of America to manufacture womens sportswear , golfwear , and activewear under the Izod brand beginning February 2018 , thus signifying Izods return to the womens clothing market . Non-golf womens Izod products were put on hiatus in 2020 , but were brought back in spring 2021 . On August 28 , 2018 , it was announced that PVH would expand the Izod brand to Europe starting with the Fall/Winter 2018 collection , initially in Spain , Germany , the Netherlands , and Scandinavia . PVH claims the launch of the Izod brand should fill in the void between fast-fashion labels and premium American brands . This was followed by more of Europe , Russia , and the Middle East in Spring 2019 . In April 2019 , it was announced that licensee Arvind was looking to sell its licensing rights to the Izod brand for the Indian market . In early 2020 , PVH announced its sustainability policy for its Izod and Van Heusen brands to eliminate single-use plastic from packaging by 2024 and use 100% sustainable cotton , polyester , and nylon by 2025 . On July 14 , 2020 , PVH announced that it would close its remaining Heritage Brands retail outlets operating mainly under the Van Heusen name , most of which also carry Izod products . The Izod and Van Heusen brands are not being discontinued ; the wholesale business , which sells their product to department stores , warehouse clubs , and online retailers , is not affected . The direct online sales platform for the Izod and Van Heusen brands will also remain active . In May 2021 , it was reported that PVH was exploring a sale of the Heritage Brands division , with Authentic Brands Group as a potential buyer . Brands .

He is the host of syndicated radio show The Mark Levin Show , as well as Life , Liberty &amp; Levin on Fox News . Levin worked in the administration of President Ronald Reagan and was a chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese . He is the former president of the Landmark Legal Foundation , a New York Times best-selling author of seven books , and contributes commentary to media outlets such as National Review Online . Since 2015 , Levin has been editor-in-chief of the Conservative Review and is known for his incendiary commentary . He has been described as right-wing by The New York Times , CNN , and Politico . He is known for his incendiary criticisms of Democrats and encouragement of primary challenges to congressional Republicans that he considers to be Republican In Name Only ( RINO ) . He endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and declared himself Never Trump , but reluctantly endorsed Donald Trump after Trump won the Republican nomination . Since the start of the Trump presidency , Levins commentary has become strongly pro-Trump . Early life and education . Mark Reed Levin , one of three boys , was born in Philadelphia to a Jewish family , and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park . His father , Jack E . Levin ( 1925–2018 ) , was the author of several books . He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974 . Skipping his senior year of high school , Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler and graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A . in Political Science in 1977 at age 19 . Later in 1977 , Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board on a platform of reducing property taxes . In 1980 , Levin earned a J.D . from Temple University School of Law . Legal and political career . Levin worked for Texas Instruments after law school . Beginning in 1981 , Levin worked in the administration of President Ronald Reagan . Levin began at ACTION , the federal agency that oversaw VISTA and other volunteer agencies , before serving as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S . Department of Education and deputy solicitor of the U.S . Department of the Interior . He ultimately became chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese . After leaving the Reagan administration , Levin practiced law in the private sector . In 1991 , Levin joined public interest law firm Landmark Legal Foundation . At Landmark , Levin served as director of legal policy and the foundations Washington-based Center for Civil Rights before becoming president in 1997 . Under Levins presidency , Landmark Legal filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in 2000 alleging that the National Education Association , the largest teachers union in the U.S. , did not disclose spending on political activity in Internal Revenue Service documentation . Landmark Legal also filed similar complaints with the United States Department of Labor in 2002 regarding NEA and political activity ; by 2006 , the NEA and smaller American Federation of Teachers had filed new documents with the Labor Department revealing over $100 million combined in political action spending . Following Freedom of Information Act requests in August 2012 of documents that would show if Environmental Protection Agency officials sought to delay regulations until after the 2012 presidential election , federal judge Royce Lamberth ruled in 2015 that although Landmark Legal did not establish that the EPA acted in bad faith , the EPA either carelessly or intentionally neglected Landmarks FOIA request . Lamberth previously ruled in 2013 that the EPA might have attempted to evade Landmarks FOIA request . In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award for his work with Landmark Legal . Politico reported in 2014 that Levin received a salary of more than $300,000 per year as president of the non-profit Landmark Legal Foundation , whose donors include the Sarah Scaife Foundation , the Charles G . Koch Charitable Foundation and ExxonMobil . In 2018 , Levin stepped down as president of Landmark Legal but remained on its board of directors . Radio broadcasting . Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs . For many years , he was a contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show , appearing more regularly as the Monica Lewinsky scandal developed . About this time Sean Hannity became aware of him , and he began to feature in Hannitys radio show . Eventually Levin gained a radio slot of his own on WABC , initially on Sundays beginning in 2002 , then in the timeslot following Hannitys program in 2003 . Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006 . Levin has participated in Freedom Concerts , an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers , and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families . Levin is also involved with Move America Forward , a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas . On February 11 , 2016 , Levin signed a ten-year contract extension with Westwood One , which will take his show through 2025 , its 19th year . On November 16 , 2018 , he was inducted to the National Radio Hall of Fame . Television shows . Since 2014 , Levin has been the founding editor-in-chief of Conservative Review , a multi-platform online television network that later merged with Glenn Becks terrestrial network TheBlaze in 2018 to form Blaze Media . Programs airing on the network include Levin , Roaming Millennial , Truth Be Told , Allie , In the Woods with Phil , Kibbe on Liberty , Louder with Crowder , America Bolling , and more . In November 2017 , Fox News announced that it had signed Levin for a weekend show titled Life , Liberty &amp; Levin to air on Sunday nights beginning in February 2018 . According to a pre-debut network news release , the programs intention was to explore the fundamental values and principles undergirding American society , culture , politics , and current events , and their relevance to the nations future and everyday lives of citizens . Writer . Levin wrote the 2005 book Men In Black : How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America , in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court ( from all parts of the political spectrum ) have legislated from the bench . Commentary magazines Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers to identify with originalists who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers , and to reject the activists who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own desired outcomes . Slate magazines Dahlia Lithwick wrote that no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution , on the ideological left or right , is going to waste their time engaging Levins arguments once theyve read this book . is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter . Liberty and Tyranny : A Conservative Manifesto was released in 2009 , and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks , as well as No . 1 on Nielsen BookScan and No . 2 on Amazon.coms list of bestselling books of 2009 . The book includes discussion of issues Levin believes need to be addressed in the United States . In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term progressive to describe modern Liberals and instead argues a proper term should be Statist . Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions , the books publisher . Andrew C . McCarthy , in The New Criterion , wrote , Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack against Americas Leftist ascendancy . Other reviewers critiqued the book as analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape while opining that Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism . Ameritopia : The Unmaking of America was issued in 2012 . In Ameritopia , Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies , the latter of which he refers to as statist , through the works of some of the leading figures in American history . Included are commentaries on works by Plato , Sir Thomas More , Thomas Hobbes , Karl Marx , John Locke , Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville . Conor Friedersdorfs review , published in The Atlantic , criticized the texts argument that statism is based on utopianism , and Carlin Romano , in The Chronicle of Higher Education , wrote that Ameritopia is really Ameritastrophe . Its disastrously bad from beginning to end . In Levins 2013 book he suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments . The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list . Hans A . von Spakovsky of National Review Online called the book required reading for conservative bloggers . Ana Marie Cox , writing in The Guardian , said the book contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution , but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project while noting the ludicrousness of his specific fixes and the near-impossibility of achieving them . Also in The Washington Times , Richard W . Rahn wrote , If The Liberty Amendments can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions , including constitutional amendments , are needed to increase liberty and prosperity , Mr . Levin will have performed a great national service . Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levins book used weak arguments . Levins Plunder and Deceit : Big Governments Exploitation of Young People and the Future was published in 2015 , and Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism in 2017 . Levins Unfreedom of the Press , which was released on May 21 , 2019 , became the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com three days before its official release , as a result of pre-order sales . Unfreedom of the Press also became a New York Times #1 best-seller on June 6 , 2019 , in the combined print &amp; e-book nonfiction and hardcover nonfiction categories . Lloyd Green was critical of the book in The Guardian writing that the book is not exactly fan fiction but it can get ahead of itself when discussing the special counsels conclusions , ending up sounding like the fake news the author and Trump both purport to abhor . Annalisa Quinn , writing for NPR , stated : the book is largely filler . Quotations and paraphrasing make up the majority of the books central chapters . Lengthy and irrelevant block quotes from historians about , say , colonial printing practices.. . give the book the air of a padded student essay . Quinn also wrote , [ Levin ] conducts no interviews , presents no original research , and visits no newsrooms , and When Levin does offer his own analysis , it can approach parody . On June 8 , 2019 , Levin appeared on C-SPAN2s Book TV to discuss Unfreedom of the Press , in which he argued that the press has lowered its standards in providing objective and trustworthy journalism . Political views . A 2016 study which sought to measure incendiary discourse on talk radio and TV found that Levin scored highest on its measure of outrage . The study looked at 10 prominent radio and television programs , known for incendiary discourse on political matters , and scored content on the basis of whether it used emotional display , misrepresentative exaggeration , mockery , conflagration , slippery slope , insulting or obscene language , and other factors , finding that Levin was the radio host who engaged in the most outrage . The study found that he utilized outrage speech or behavior at a rate of more than one instance per minute . In How Democracies Die , Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write that Mark Levin was among the popular right-wing talk radio hosts who helped to legitimate the use of uncivil discourse in American politics , and contribute to the erosion of democratic norms . According to Politico , Levin has a penchant for hysteria . Views on politicians and other individuals . According to The Guardian , constant attacks on Democrats and the left are important components of Levins modus operandi . According to Politico in May 2009 , Levin pronounced almost daily that Obama was a failure , a liar , and a statist who is trying to destroy individual freedom . In June 2017 , Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being a radical Marxist who believes in violence . According to Rutgers University political scientist Stephen Eric Bronner , Levin tends to use socialism as a catch-all term to condemn any policy that strengthens the social welfare function of the state . In July 2014 , he called Jon Stewart a knee-jerk idiot , and suggested that Stewart was a self-hating Jew . He has stated that Nancy Pelosis politics comes as close to a form of modern-day fascism as Ive ever seen . In January 2019 , he said Pelosi was Americas first fascist . And thats a fact . Levin said the new Congressional Speaker had hijacked the federal government by deciding to block the financing of President Trumps border wall . Levin has also mocked how Pelosi looks , referred to Beto ORourke as a weak man , and called Dick Blumenthal a pathetic , loathsome liar . He has criticized Republicans – including Paul Ryan , Lindsey Graham , John McCain , and Mitch McConnell – with whom he disagrees . He sometimes refers to such individuals as RINOs . Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when he faced a primary challenge in 2012 , but later apologized for his endorsement when Hatch said that he would be willing to support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants . Since then , he endorsed a number of Republican primary challengers to incumbent Republican senators . Levin supported the Tea Party Patriots campaign to fire House Speaker John Boehner . Earlier in 2010 , Levin criticized Glenn Beck for his criticism of congressional Republicans . He has referred to Mitt Romney as an ass and called CNN host Brian Stelter a creep . Levin supported U.S . Representative Mo Brooks in his campaign in the 2017 Alabama special election against incumbent Luther Strange , who had received a temporary appointment earlier that year . Levin strongly defended former EPA head Scott Pruitt while he was under a dozen separate ethics investigations . Levin said Pruitts policies on the whole have been outstanding , and I dont throw good people under the bus because the left targets them . Sponsorship and conflicts of interest . During the 2012 election cycle , Levins show was paid at least $757,000 in sponsorship by the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity to run ads for the group , a deal which began in the summer of 2010 . After the sponsorship ended , Levin began making ads for the Tea Party Patriots . The Senate Conservatives Fund paid Simon &amp; Schuster at least $427,000 for copies of Levins Liberty or Tyranny in September and October 2013 . During the same period , on his radio show and Facebook page , Levin frequently promoted the group , which has funded primary challengers of Senate Republicans . Levin did not disclose that the group had made $427,000 of purchases of his book . Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) which also endorsed Hatch . Levin withdrew his endorsement of Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots . Levin dismissed the allegations that he engages in pay-to-play . President Obama . In 2009 , Levin described as absolutely right the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Obamacare ) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care . In 2011 , a caller to Levins show , claiming to be a neurosurgeon , said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments . Levin said to the caller , so Sarah Palin was right . The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false . In late 2013 , Levin said there were similarities between a gathering of hand-picked supporters of the Affordable Care Act chosen by the Obama administration to Nazi Sturmabteilung or Brownshirts drawing comparisons of the propaganda techniques of the two groups . Levin stated in 2013 that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government and described President Obama as a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer . He speculated in November 2014 that , after the 2014 mid-term elections , Obama might go full Mussolini . In February 2015 , Levin stated that President Obama was seeking to destroy Israel because Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism . He blamed Obama for the Ebola crisis : the political policies of this administration which opens the door wide to people from the poorest parts of the world . We dont know who they are , we dont know if they have diseases . WMDs in Iraq . In 2014 , Levin claimed that the Bush administrations original WMD rationale for the Iraq War had been vindicated by citing reports of U.S . soldiers in Iraq that were wounded by the decayed remnants of Saddam Husseins chemical weapons arsenal . The remnants in question were degraded and unusable chemical weapons shells from the 1980s . Levin faulted the Bush administration for not doing more to publicize these remnants of Iraqs former WMD program . Donald Trump . In March 2016 , Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination . Over a month after Donald Trump was nominated , in September 2016 , Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Trump in the presidential election , following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the Never Trump camp and would never vote for Trump . He qualified his support by stating : I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say . Wiretap claim . In March 2017 , Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used police state surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election . The Associated Press said that Levin voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower . Levin protested the AP report vigorously , demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers . His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and reportedly became the basis of President Trumps unfounded Trump Tower wiretapping allegations . In September 2017 , reports emerged of a court-ordered Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) wiretap on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ; while certain Trump supporters alleged that this surveillance vindicated Levin and Trumps unsupported assertions , The Atlantic commented : This is not true – Trump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered , politically motivated surveillance , for which there remains no evidence . Deep State conspiracy theories . Levin has said that there is a coup occurring against the presidency of Donald Trump waged by Obama loyalists . Levins coup claim was referring to investigations of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and of alleged obstruction of justice by Trump . He has suggested that former FBI Director James Comey used the Trump-Russia dossier to blackmail the president . He has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller engaged in a Deep State coup against Trump . In February 2018 , Levin said the Nunes Memo shows Hillary Clinton paid for a warrant and Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians...it appears the FBI at the senior-most levels colluded with the Russians too . In August 2018 , Levin stated that Mueller is a greater threat to this Republic and Constitution than anything Vladimir Putin did during the [ 2016 ] campaign . When the Attorney General Bill Barr issued his summary of Muellers Special Counsel report considering Russian interference in the 2016 election , Levin called the second volume of the report crap . Of the prosecutor he suggested : Who gives a damn what the prosecutor said ? He insisted the special counsel was not God . He is not a judge . He is not a jury ! Trump–Ukraine scandal . After President Trump pressed the President of Ukraine to start an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son , Levin strongly defended Trumps actions . Asked on Fox &amp; Friends whether Levin was okay with Trump asking a foreign leader for dirt on Biden , Levin lashed out at the Fox &amp; Friends host and repeatedly shouted there was no problem with what Trump did . Shortly thereafter , Trump praised Levin and retweeted more than 20 tweets by viewers praising Levin . Levin also accused Joe Biden of being the one who did something illegal , though he did not provide evidence or any elaboration . In October 2019 , while Trump was the subject of the impeachment inquiry , Levin said that on his Blaze TV show : While hes been president there hasnt even been a hint of scandal . Not a hint ! He was highly critical of Mitt Romney who increased his criticisms of President Trump during this period.&lt;ref 2020 election . Following the 2020 presidential election as all significant media organizations reported Joe Biden had won , Levin told his radio audience , the Democrats were stealing the election . He insisted on Twitter to his 2.4 million followers : theres lots of evidence of voter fraud and election screw-ups . On the same platform on November 5 , Levin called on Republican-controlled state legislatures to disregard the results of the 2020 election and send electors to the Electoral College who would vote for Trump . The suggestion was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr . He praised Sidney Powell , a member of Trumps legal team , for what he considered to be her patriotism after she promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and sought to overturn election results . He frequently had guests on his show who led the audience to think Joe Bidens win in the presidential election could be overturned . On January 5 , 2021 , Levin insisted Congresss imminent counting of the Electoral College votes was an act of tyranny because of the supposed fraud . He told his listeners , If we dont fight on Jan . 6 on the floor of the Senate and the House.. . then we are done . Following the next days storming of the Capitol in Washington , he continued in the same vein . It appears nothing has changed in 24 hours.. . Not a damn thing . The never-Trumpers , the RINOs , the media — same damn thing , although he was critical of the rioters . Meanwhile , on the same day as the riot , Cumulus Media circulated a memo instructing its presenters , a roster which includes Levin , to cease implying the 2021 presidential election was stolen or face the end of the right to broadcast via Cumulus . COVID-19 pandemic . During the COVID-19 pandemic , Levin downplayed the threat of the virus , arguing that the media was overreacting and that the death toll from the flu was lower than the coronavirus . Personal life . Levin suffered a heart attack in 2000 and had open heart surgery . He was married to Kendall Levin and they divorced . He is currently married to Julie Prince .

Under Levins presidency , Landmark Legal filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in 2000 alleging that the National Education Association , the largest teachers union in the U.S. , did not disclose spending on political activity in Internal Revenue Service documentation . Landmark Legal also filed similar complaints with the United States Department of Labor in 2002 regarding NEA and political activity ; by 2006 , the NEA and smaller American Federation of Teachers had filed new documents with the Labor Department revealing over $100 million combined in political action spending . Following Freedom of Information Act requests in August 2012 of documents that would show if Environmental Protection Agency officials sought to delay regulations until after the 2012 presidential election , federal judge Royce Lamberth ruled in 2015 that although Landmark Legal did not establish that the EPA acted in bad faith , the EPA either carelessly or intentionally neglected Landmarks FOIA request . Lamberth previously ruled in 2013 that the EPA might have attempted to evade Landmarks FOIA request . Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs .

She was the daughter of John , Duke of Berry , and Joanna of Armagnac . She was married three times . She acted as administrator of the Duchy of Bourbon for her third spouse John I , Duke of Bourbon , during his imprisonment in England after he was captured following the French defeat at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , until 1434 . Life . Marie was born about the year 1375 , the youngest daughter of John the Magnificent , Duke of Berry and Joanna of Armagnac . Through her father , a great collector of antiquities , art patron and bibliophile , she was a granddaughter of King John II of France . She had three brothers , Charles , Louis , and John ; and one older sister , Bonne . Countess consort of Châtillon . The first of Maries three marriages took place on 29 May 1386 in the Cathedral of Saint-Etienne at Bourges : aged about 11 , Marie married Louis III de Châtillon as her first husband . Maries father gave her a dowry of 70,000 francs ; he gave Louis , his son-in-law , the county of Dunois . The marriage and trousseau had been arranged by the two fathers in 1384 : A Duke will dress her , in bed and out of it , and a Count will put the jewels on her , John Duke of Berry and Guy Count de Blois-Châtillon agreed . The festivities at the wedding de ces jeunes enfants ( of these young children ) are described in Jean Froissarts Chronicles . Countess of Eu . There were no children from this marriage , and Louis died on 15 July 1391 . On 27 January 1393 a marriage contract was drawn up for Marie and Philip of Artois , Count of Eu . They were married the next month at the Palais du Louvre in Paris ; King Charles VI of France himself paid for the festivities , while her father gave her a dowry of 70,000 francs . They had two sons and two daughters . The King appointed Philip Constable in 1392 . Philippe went on Crusade and fought alongside his friend Jean Le Maingre ( Boucicaut ) , marshal of France at the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis on 25 September 1396 . Both were captured , and Philip died some months later in captivity at Micalizo , now called Mihalıççık , in western Turkey . After Philippes death inter Sarracenos ( among the Saracens ) , his body was brought back to Eu , his home town , and Marie gave an endowment of £100 annually to the Collegial Church of Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Laurent for a mass to be celebrated there on 17 June each year in his memory . Their eldest son , Philippe , died on 23 December in the same year and is also buried in Eu . Jointly with her widowed sister-in-law , Jeanne of Thouars , Marie was appointed guardian of the three surviving children of her marriage with Philippe : Charles , Bonne and Catherine . Aged about three , Charles succeeded his father as Count of Eu . His revenues were held for him until he came of age by three trustees : Marie herself , her father , and her uncle Philip the Bold , Duke of Burgundy . Duchess consort of Bourbon . Marie married her third husband John of Bourbon at the Kings Palace ( the Palais de la Cité ) in Paris on 21 June 1401 . The contract had been signed at Paris on 27 May 1400 after complex negotiations . She bore him three children . He was appointed Grand Chamberlain of France on 18 March 1408 and succeeded his father as Duke of Bourbon on 19 August 1410 . Maries father had persuaded King Charles VI not to fight at the battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415 , but Maries husband did fight , was captured , and spent the rest of his life in English captivity . Marie is believed to be depicted in one or possibly two full-page miniatures in the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry , a lavishly-illustrated manuscript made for her father in the years after his sons deaths . In the illustration for the month of April , the young noblemen and women in the foreground are grouped around a couple agreeing to be married . According to Patricia Stirnemann , referencing Saint-Jean Boudin , the scene , although not painted until about 1410 , depicts the engagement of Marie with John of Bourbon in 1401 . Raymond Cazelles disputes this , arguing that the couple are Maries niece Bonne of Armagnac and Charles , Duke of Orléans , who were to marry in 1411 . A May Day celebration among nobles takes place in the foreground of the illustration for the month of May . Details appear to confirm that the house of Bourbon is represented . Both Cazelles and Stirnemann believe that the woman seen in the foreground , riding on a white horse and wearing a large white headdress , is Marie on the occasion of her marriage on 21 June 1401 . These scholars do not agree as to which of the accompanying men is John of Bourbon . The buildings in the background have been variously identified , but G . Papertiant suggests that they are the Châtelet , Conciergerie and Tour de lHorloge in Paris , and at the centre the Palais de la Cité where Maries wedding took place . A manuscript made for Maries own use and presented to her in 1406 survives today as BnF , fr . 926 . It is a short collection of Christian devotional works , beginning with Bonaventures Stimulus amoris , translated into French by Simon de Courcy as the Traitieé de lesguillon damour divine . It includes a miniature of Marie and her daughter Bonne ( aged about ten at this time ) kneeling in prayer before the Virgin Mary . The manuscript is now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France . Marie also selected approximately 40 manuscripts from among her fathers collection on his death , as she was still owed the 70,000 franc dowry from her second marriage . Duchess of Auvergne and Countess of Montpensier . All three of Maries brothers were dead before 1400 , which explains the complexity of the negotiations for her third marriage : she and her elder sister Bonne were to be heirs to John of Berrys titles , which required royal assent . John of Berry died on 15 June 1416 ( by which time Maries husband was already a prisoner in England ) . Marie was accordingly appointed Duchess of Auvergne and Countess of Montpensier on 26 April 1418 ; these titles were confirmed in 1425 . On 17 January 1421 , her husband appointed her administrator of his estates as well . He died a prisoner in London in January 1434 . Marie died in Lyon on an unknown date in June of the same year . She was buried at Souvigny Priory .

He served as the inaugural federal leader of the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) from 1901 to 1907 and was the first member of the party to serve as prime minister . Watson was born in Valparaíso , the son of a German Chilean seaman . He grew up on the South Island of New Zealand , taking the surname of his step-father when his Irish-born mother remarried . He left school at a young age , working in the printing industry as a compositor . Watson moved to Sydney in 1886 and became prominent in the local labour movement . He helped establish the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales and directed the partys campaign at the 1891 general election . Watson was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1894 election , aged 27 , and quickly became a leading figure in the ALP . He and most party members opposed Federation on the grounds that the proposed constitution was undemocratic . In 1901 , Watson was elected to the House of Representatives at the inaugural federal election . He became a founding member of the ALP caucus in federal parliament and was elected as the partys inaugural leader . During the first term of parliament he supported the Liberal Protectionist governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin , and was a strong supporter of the White Australia policy . At the 1903 election , the ALP secured the balance of power in the House and a strong position in the Senate . Watson formed a minority government in April 1904 , aged 37 , after the ALP withdrew its support from Deakin . He was one of the first socialists to head a government in a parliamentary system , attracting international attention , and remains Australias youngest prime minister . After less than four months in office , the Watson Government lost a confidence motion and Watson was succeeded as prime minister by anti-socialist George Reid . He served as leader of the opposition until 1905 , when he helped reinstall Deakin as prime minister . The ALP continued to offer its support to Deakin after the 1906 election , despite the opposition of some in the party . Watson resigned the partys leadership in 1907 , citing family concerns , and left parliament at the 1910 election . He was expelled from the ALP during the 1916 split over conscription and became a Nationalist , although he never again stood for public office . He subsequently had a successful business career , including as president of the NRMA and chairman of Ampol . While Watson did not succeed in passing legislation while in office , his term as prime minister is seen as significant as a demonstration that the ALP could form a competent government . His successor as party leader Andrew Fisher would lead the ALP to a majority government at the 1910 election , in which many of Watsons ministers played a key role . Early life . Birth and family background . Watson was born Johan Cristian Tanck on 9 April 1867 in Valparaíso , Chile . He was the only child of Martha ( née Minchin ) and Johan Cristian Tanck senior . His father was also born in Valparaíso , a German Chilean who ancestors had immigrated from the Kingdom of Hanover and established an import–export firm . He worked as a merchant seaman , possibly a ships carpenter , on trade routes across the Pacific . He arrived in New Zealand aboard La Joven Julia on 24 December 1865 and married Martha Minchin in Port Chalmers less than a month later , on 19 January 1866 . Their marriage was later registered at Valparaísos Iglesia de la Matriz . Watsons mother was born in County Tipperary , Ireland , and was 16 years old at the time of her first marriage . She joined Tanck on board the Julia , which eventually returned to Chile and docked in Valparaíso a few days before Watsons birth . In the months after his birth the ship worked a regular route carrying timber between Valparaíso and Chiloé Island . In 1868 , Watson moved to New Zealand with his mother , returning to her family on the South Island . The fate of his father is uncertain , as no records of his death have been found . On 15 February 1869 , his mother married George Thomas Watson at the registry office in Waipori , describing herself as a widow . Her second husband was a 30-year-old miner born in Ballymoney , Ireland , who had come to New Zealand after several years working in Scotland . Watson came to have nine half-siblings from his mothers second marriage , born between 1869 and 1887 . He was treated as the biological child of George Watson , adopting his step-fathers surname ; his given names were also anglicised . As an adult , Watson gave incorrect and contradictory information about the circumstances of his birth and the identity of his parents . He allowed some biographical profiles to list him as born in New Zealand , while his second wife and daughter understood that he had been born to British parents in international waters outside Valparaíso . On legal documents he listed George Watson as his biological father and provided an incorrect maiden name for his mother . Watsons biographers have suggested he may have originally concealed his background for convenience , but later deliberately did so for political reasons , including concerns over parliamentary eligibility and possible xenophobia . Birth overseas to a non-British father would make him an alien ineligible for election to federal parliament under section 44 ( i ) of the constitution . Childhood and move to Australia . Watson attended the state school in Oamaru , North Otago , New Zealand until ten years of age when he left to become a rail nipper . Then after a period of helping on the family farm , at thirteen years of age he was apprenticed as a compositor at The North Otago Times , a newspaper run by prominent reformist politician William Steward , with the public affairs exposure augmenting his minor formal schooling . Following the death of his mother and the loss of his job , he migrated to Sydney in 1886 at nineteen years of age . He worked for a month as a stablehand at Government House , then found employment as a compositor for a number of newspapers including The Daily Telegraph , The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Star . Through this proximity to newspapers , books and writers he furthered his education and developed an interest in politics and became active in the printing union . He married Ada Jane Low , a British-born Sydney seamstress , at the Unitarian Church on Liverpool Street in Sydney on 27 November 1889 . Colonial parliament . In the months prior to the 1891 New South Wales colonial election , Watson was a founding member of the Labour Electoral League of New South Wales which stemmed from the nascent Australian labour movement and would later develop into the Australian Labour ( later Labor ) Party . In the election , Labour won the balance of power and provided confidence and supply to the Protectionist Party minority government led by Premier George Dibbs which brought down the incumbent majority government of the Free Trade Party led by Premier Henry Parkes . Watson was an active trade unionist , and became Vice-President of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council in January 1892 . In June 1892 , he settled a dispute between the Trades and Labour Council and the Labour Party and as a result became the president of the council and chairman of the party . In 1893 and 1894 , he worked hard to resolve the debate over the solidarity pledge and established the Labour Partys basic practices , including the sovereignty of the party conference , caucus solidarity , the pledge required of parliamentarians and the powerful role of the extra-parliamentary executive . At the 1894 colonial election which saw the defeat of the Protectionist Party government , Watson was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the country seat of Young . At the 1895 colonial election the incumbent Free Trade Party minority government led by Premier George Reid increased their support but remained several seats short of a majority . Labour at this time had a policy of support in return for concessions , and Watson voted with his colleagues to strategically provide such legislative support to the incumbent government . Following the 1898 colonial election , despite a significant swing against the incumbent government , Watson and Labour leader James McGowen decided to allow the incumbent government to remain so that it could complete the work of establishing the Federation of Australia . Federation . Watson was involved in shaping party policy regarding the movement for Federation from 1895 , and was one of ten Labour candidates nominated for the Australasian Federal Convention on 4 March 1897 , but none of these candidates managed to be elected . The party endorsed Federation , but nevertheless most leading party figures viewed the draft Commonwealth Constitution as undemocratic , and believed that the Senate as proposed was much too powerful , similar to the anti-reformist Colonial state upper houses and the UK House of Lords . When the draft was submitted to a referendum on 3 June 1898 , Labour opposed it , with Watson prominent in the campaign , and saw the referendum rejected . Watson was devoted to the idea of the referendum as an ideal feature of democracy . To ensure that Reid might finally bring New South Wales into national union on an amended draft constitution , Watson helped to negotiate a deal , involving the party executive , that included the nomination of four Labour members to the New South Wales Legislative Council . At the March 1899 annual party conference , Billy Hughes and Holman moved to have those arrangements nullified and party policy on Federation changed , thus thwarting Reids plans . Although rarely known to resort to anger , on this occasion Watson jumped to his feet in a most excited manner and in heated tones .. . contended .. . that they should not interfere with the referendum . The motion was lost and the four party men were nominated to the council on 4 April . The bill approving the second referendum , to be held on 20 June 1899 , was passed on 20 April . Labour leaders , including Watson opposed the final terms of the Commonwealth Constitution . Nonetheless , they could not stop it from going ahead , and Watson , unlike Holman and Hughes , believed that it should be submitted to the people . Nevertheless , Watson joined all but two of the Labour parliamentarians in campaigning against the Yes vote at the referendum . When the Constitution was accepted , he agreed that the mandate of the majority will have to be obeyed . Federal parliament . Watson was elected to the new federal Parliament of Australia at the inaugural 1901 federal election , representing the rural House of Representatives rural seat of Bland . Watson arrived in Melbourne , which at the time served as the temporary seat of government , in May 1901 . Watson was elected the first leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party ( usually known as the Caucus ) on 8 May 1901 , the day before the opening of the parliament . Watson pursued the same policy as Labor had done in New South Wales , where Labor was the smallest of the three parties but held the balance of power . Under Watson , Labor provided confidence and supply to the Protectionist Party minority governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin in exchange for legislation enacting the Labour platform , such as the immensely popular White Australia policy which left the free Trade Party led by George Reid to form the opposition . Watson , as a Labor moderate , genuinely admired Deakin and shared his liberal views on many subjects . Deakin reciprocated this sentiment . Deakin wrote in one of his anonymous articles in a London newspaper that The Labour section has much cause for gratitude to Mr Watson , the leader whose tact and judgement have enabled it to achieve many of its Parliamentary successes . White Australia . Watson was a white nationalist and white supremacist who played a key role in the creation of the White Australia policy . According to , the ideal of a white Australia stood at the centre of Watsons political ideology , a touchstone of Australian identity that Watson repeatedly stressed in interviews , speeches and articles . However , some of his biographers have noted that his racial views were widespread among Australians at the time and that all three major parties supported White Australia . During the debate over what became the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 , Watson stated that the issue of racial purity was the larger and more important one for the passage of the bill , where some speakers had emphasised concerns over the economic impact of cheap foreign labour . He opposed the governments dictation test provision on the grounds that it could be easily circumvented , and that education does not eliminate the objectionable qualities of the Baboo Hindoo . He instead sought to explicitly ban any Asian or African from entering Australia . During the same debate he spoke of racial contamination and referred to Chinese people using a racial slur , rhetorically asking whether we would desire that our sisters or our brothers should be married into any of these races to which we object . In 1905 , Watson drafted a new plank for the ALP platform calling for an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity . He successfully moved for its adoption at both state and federal conferences , stating that the party should cleanse their own doorstep with the hope that thus the street would be cleansed . Prime Minister in 1904 . Labour under Watson doubled their vote at the 1903 federal election and continued to hold the balance of power despite all three parties holding about the same number of seats . In April 1904 , however , Watson and Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover state public servants , the fallout causing Deakin to resign . Reid declined to take office , which saw Watson become the first Labour Prime Minister of Australia , the worlds first Labour head of government at a national level ( Anderson Dawson had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899 ) , indeed the worlds first socialist or social democratic government at a national level . He was aged only 37 , and remains the youngest Prime Minister in Australias history . Billy Hughes later recalled the first meeting of the Labour Cabinet with characteristic sharp wit : Despite the apparent fitness of the new Prime Minister for his role , the government hung on the fine thread of Deakins promise of fair play . The triumph of the historic first Australian Labour government was a qualified one – Labour did not have the numbers to implement key policies . The three elevens – the lack of a definite majority in the parliament after the second federal election – dogged Watson just as it had Deakin . Six bills were enacted during Watsons brief government . All but one – an amended Acts Interpretation Act 1904 – were supply bills . The most significant legislative achievement of the Watson government was the advancement of the troublesome Conciliation and Arbitration Bill . Another accomplishment was the appointing of a Royal Commission on a Bill related to Navigation and Shipping , whose report ( presented a couple of years later ) led to major redrafting of the Navigation Act and improvements in conditions for Australian seamen . Once he became the Prime Minister Watson recognized the limitations of his position in the Labour caucus and endorsed the concept of a deputy leader . Andrew Fisher won the position by one vote over the more dynamic Billy Hughes . Defeat and final years as leader . Although Watson sought a dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held , the Governor-General Lord Northcote refused . Unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives , Watson resigned the premiership less than four months after taking office , his term ending on 18 August 1904 ( Deakin was later defeated on a similar bill ) . Reid became Prime Minister and four months later his government managed to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill after compromising to extend the scope to state public servants as Watson had proposed . Deakin again became Prime Minister after Reid lost confidence of the parliament in July 1905 . Watson led Labour to the 1906 federal election and improved their position again . At this election the seat of Bland was abolished , so he shifted to the seat of South Sydney . But in October 1907 , recognising his work for the foundation of the parliamentary party was complete and also due to fatigue and concern over the health of his wife Ada , he resigned the Labour leadership in favour of Andrew Fisher . Watson retired from politics , aged only 42 , prior to the 1910 federal election , at which Labour won with 50 percent of the primary vote . It was the first time a party had been elected to majority government in the House of Representatives , it was also the first time a party won a Senate majority , and it was the worlds first Labour Party majority government at a national level . The ALP vote had risen rapidly , going from 15 percent against two larger and more established parties in 1901 , to 50 percent in 1910 , after a majority of the Protectionist Party merged with the Anti-Socialist Party , creating the Commonwealth Liberal Party which received 45 percent . Later life . Political activities . In the Australian Labor Party split of 1916 , numerous Labor MPs were expelled from the party for supporting World War I conscription in Australia . Watson sided with ex-Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes and the conscriptionists and had his party membership terminated as a result . Watson remained active in the affairs of Hughes Nationalist Party until 1922 , but after that he drifted out of politics altogether . In 1931 he was state president of the Australian Industries Protection League and supported the Scullin Governments high-tariff policies . Business activities . In December 1910 , Watson was recruited by a syndicate of Sydney businessmen to lead a gold-seeking expedition in South Africa . He also engaged in land speculation in Sutherland , but development did not occur rapidly enough . He was appointed as a director of Labor Papers Limited , the publisher of the AWUs official newspaper The Australian Worker . Watson joined the council of the newly established National Roads Association ( NRA ) in March 1920 , and in August was elected as the associations inaugural president . The NRA was intended as a peak body for New South Wales motorists , lobbying the state government to create a Main Roads Board and borrow money to improve local highways . It was initially hampered by its small membership and lack of financial resources , with a budget of only £15 per week . Watson was able to attract publicity through the launch of a magazine and a successful campaign to raise speed limits . He was again chosen as president in 1923 when the NRA was reorganised into the National Roads and Motorists Association ( NRMA ) , and would retain the position for the rest of his life . By the end of the following year the organisation had grown from 550 to 5,000 members . It subsequently expanded into vehicle insurance and motor touring , acquiring a series of properties for camping . As well as his involvement with the NRMA , Watson also served as a director of a taxi company , Yellow Cabs of Australia Ltd. , and as chairman of the state governments Traffic Advisory Committee . In 1936 he became the inaugural chairman of petrol retailer Ampol . Personal life . Watsons first wife Ada died in 1921 . On 30 October 1925 he married Antonia Mary Gladys Dowlan in the same church as his first wedding . She was a 23-year-old waitress from Western Australia whom he had met when she served his table at a Sydney club . In 1927 , they had one daughter , Jacqueline Dunn née Watson . Watson and his second wife moved to a villa in Double Bay in 1934 . In retirement he became a keen bridge player and was also a regular attendee at Randwick Racecourse and the Sydney Cricket Ground , serving on the SCG Trust . He visited the United States for business reasons and also returned to New Zealand on a number of occasions in a private capacity . After several weeks of ill health , Watson died at his home in Double Bay on 18 November 1941 , aged 74 . He was granted a state funeral at St Andrews Cathedral , with Joseph Cook , Albert Gardiner , John Curtin and William McKell serving as pallbearers . His ashes were interred at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium . Evaluation and honours . According to Percival Serle , Watson left a much greater impression on his time than this would suggest . He came at the right moment for his party , and nothing could have done it more good than the sincerity , courtesy and moderation which he always showed as a leader .

He served as the inaugural federal leader of the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) from 1901 to 1907 and was the first member of the party to serve as prime minister . In 1901 , Watson was elected to the House of Representatives at the inaugural federal election . He became a founding member of the ALP caucus in federal parliament and was elected as the partys inaugural leader . During the first term of parliament he supported the Liberal Protectionist governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin , and was a strong supporter of the White Australia policy . At the 1903 election , the ALP secured the balance of power in the House and a strong position in the Senate . Watson formed a minority government in April 1904 , aged 37 , after the ALP withdrew its support from Deakin . He was one of the first socialists to head a government in a parliamentary system , attracting international attention , and remains Australias youngest prime minister . Watson was elected to the new federal Parliament of Australia at the inaugural 1901 federal election , representing the rural House of Representatives rural seat of Bland . Watson arrived in Melbourne , which at the time served as the temporary seat of government , in May 1901 . Watson was elected the first leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party ( usually known as the Caucus ) on 8 May 1901 , the day before the opening of the parliament . During the debate over what became the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 , Watson stated that the issue of racial purity was the larger and more important one for the passage of the bill , where some speakers had emphasised concerns over the economic impact of cheap foreign labour . He opposed the governments dictation test provision on the grounds that it could be easily circumvented , and that education does not eliminate the objectionable qualities of the Baboo Hindoo . He instead sought to explicitly ban any Asian or African from entering Australia . During the same debate he spoke of racial contamination and referred to Chinese people using a racial slur , rhetorically asking whether we would desire that our sisters or our brothers should be married into any of these races to which we object . In 1905 , Watson drafted a new plank for the ALP platform calling for an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity . He successfully moved for its adoption at both state and federal conferences , stating that the party should cleanse their own doorstep with the hope that thus the street would be cleansed . Prime Minister in 1904 . Labour under Watson doubled their vote at the 1903 federal election and continued to hold the balance of power despite all three parties holding about the same number of seats . In April 1904 , however , Watson and Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover state public servants , the fallout causing Deakin to resign . Reid declined to take office , which saw Watson become the first Labour Prime Minister of Australia , the worlds first Labour head of government at a national level ( Anderson Dawson had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899 ) , indeed the worlds first socialist or social democratic government at a national level . He was aged only 37 , and remains the youngest Prime Minister in Australias history . Six bills were enacted during Watsons brief government . All but one – an amended Acts Interpretation Act 1904 – were supply bills . The most significant legislative achievement of the Watson government was the advancement of the troublesome Conciliation and Arbitration Bill . Another accomplishment was the appointing of a Royal Commission on a Bill related to Navigation and Shipping , whose report ( presented a couple of years later ) led to major redrafting of the Navigation Act and improvements in conditions for Australian seamen . Once he became the Prime Minister Watson recognized the limitations of his position in the Labour caucus and endorsed the concept of a deputy leader . Andrew Fisher won the position by one vote over the more dynamic Billy Hughes . Although Watson sought a dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held , the Governor-General Lord Northcote refused . Unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives , Watson resigned the premiership less than four months after taking office , his term ending on 18 August 1904 ( Deakin was later defeated on a similar bill ) . Reid became Prime Minister and four months later his government managed to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill after compromising to extend the scope to state public servants as Watson had proposed . Watson retired from politics , aged only 42 , prior to the 1910 federal election , at which Labour won with 50 percent of the primary vote . It was the first time a party had been elected to majority government in the House of Representatives , it was also the first time a party won a Senate majority , and it was the worlds first Labour Party majority government at a national level . The ALP vote had risen rapidly , going from 15 percent against two larger and more established parties in 1901 , to 50 percent in 1910 , after a majority of the Protectionist Party merged with the Anti-Socialist Party , creating the Commonwealth Liberal Party which received 45 percent .</p><p>pred_time: House of Representatives</p><p>groundtruth: </p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-251"/wiki/Chris_Watson#P39#3</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/Chris_Watson#P39#3<p>context: Chris Watson John Christian Watson ( born Johan Cristian Tanck ; 9 April 186718 November 1941 ) was an Australian politician who served as the third prime minister of Australia , in office from 27 April to 18 August 1904 . He served as the inaugural federal leader of the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) from 1901 to 1907 and was the first member of the party to serve as prime minister . Watson was born in Valparaíso , the son of a German Chilean seaman . He grew up on the South Island of New Zealand , taking the surname of his step-father when his Irish-born mother remarried . He left school at a young age , working in the printing industry as a compositor . Watson moved to Sydney in 1886 and became prominent in the local labour movement . He helped establish the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales and directed the partys campaign at the 1891 general election . Watson was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1894 election , aged 27 , and quickly became a leading figure in the ALP . He and most party members opposed Federation on the grounds that the proposed constitution was undemocratic . In 1901 , Watson was elected to the House of Representatives at the inaugural federal election . He became a founding member of the ALP caucus in federal parliament and was elected as the partys inaugural leader . During the first term of parliament he supported the Liberal Protectionist governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin , and was a strong supporter of the White Australia policy . At the 1903 election , the ALP secured the balance of power in the House and a strong position in the Senate . Watson formed a minority government in April 1904 , aged 37 , after the ALP withdrew its support from Deakin . He was one of the first socialists to head a government in a parliamentary system , attracting international attention , and remains Australias youngest prime minister . After less than four months in office , the Watson Government lost a confidence motion and Watson was succeeded as prime minister by anti-socialist George Reid . He served as leader of the opposition until 1905 , when he helped reinstall Deakin as prime minister . The ALP continued to offer its support to Deakin after the 1906 election , despite the opposition of some in the party . Watson resigned the partys leadership in 1907 , citing family concerns , and left parliament at the 1910 election . He was expelled from the ALP during the 1916 split over conscription and became a Nationalist , although he never again stood for public office . He subsequently had a successful business career , including as president of the NRMA and chairman of Ampol . While Watson did not succeed in passing legislation while in office , his term as prime minister is seen as significant as a demonstration that the ALP could form a competent government . His successor as party leader Andrew Fisher would lead the ALP to a majority government at the 1910 election , in which many of Watsons ministers played a key role . Early life . Birth and family background . Watson was born Johan Cristian Tanck on 9 April 1867 in Valparaíso , Chile . He was the only child of Martha ( née Minchin ) and Johan Cristian Tanck senior . His father was also born in Valparaíso , a German Chilean who ancestors had immigrated from the Kingdom of Hanover and established an import–export firm . He worked as a merchant seaman , possibly a ships carpenter , on trade routes across the Pacific . He arrived in New Zealand aboard La Joven Julia on 24 December 1865 and married Martha Minchin in Port Chalmers less than a month later , on 19 January 1866 . Their marriage was later registered at Valparaísos Iglesia de la Matriz . Watsons mother was born in County Tipperary , Ireland , and was 16 years old at the time of her first marriage . She joined Tanck on board the Julia , which eventually returned to Chile and docked in Valparaíso a few days before Watsons birth . In the months after his birth the ship worked a regular route carrying timber between Valparaíso and Chiloé Island . In 1868 , Watson moved to New Zealand with his mother , returning to her family on the South Island . The fate of his father is uncertain , as no records of his death have been found . On 15 February 1869 , his mother married George Thomas Watson at the registry office in Waipori , describing herself as a widow . Her second husband was a 30-year-old miner born in Ballymoney , Ireland , who had come to New Zealand after several years working in Scotland . Watson came to have nine half-siblings from his mothers second marriage , born between 1869 and 1887 . He was treated as the biological child of George Watson , adopting his step-fathers surname ; his given names were also anglicised . As an adult , Watson gave incorrect and contradictory information about the circumstances of his birth and the identity of his parents . He allowed some biographical profiles to list him as born in New Zealand , while his second wife and daughter understood that he had been born to British parents in international waters outside Valparaíso . On legal documents he listed George Watson as his biological father and provided an incorrect maiden name for his mother . Watsons biographers have suggested he may have originally concealed his background for convenience , but later deliberately did so for political reasons , including concerns over parliamentary eligibility and possible xenophobia . Birth overseas to a non-British father would make him an alien ineligible for election to federal parliament under section 44 ( i ) of the constitution . Childhood and move to Australia . Watson attended the state school in Oamaru , North Otago , New Zealand until ten years of age when he left to become a rail nipper . Then after a period of helping on the family farm , at thirteen years of age he was apprenticed as a compositor at The North Otago Times , a newspaper run by prominent reformist politician William Steward , with the public affairs exposure augmenting his minor formal schooling . Following the death of his mother and the loss of his job , he migrated to Sydney in 1886 at nineteen years of age . He worked for a month as a stablehand at Government House , then found employment as a compositor for a number of newspapers including The Daily Telegraph , The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Star . Through this proximity to newspapers , books and writers he furthered his education and developed an interest in politics and became active in the printing union . He married Ada Jane Low , a British-born Sydney seamstress , at the Unitarian Church on Liverpool Street in Sydney on 27 November 1889 . Colonial parliament . In the months prior to the 1891 New South Wales colonial election , Watson was a founding member of the Labour Electoral League of New South Wales which stemmed from the nascent Australian labour movement and would later develop into the Australian Labour ( later Labor ) Party . In the election , Labour won the balance of power and provided confidence and supply to the Protectionist Party minority government led by Premier George Dibbs which brought down the incumbent majority government of the Free Trade Party led by Premier Henry Parkes . Watson was an active trade unionist , and became Vice-President of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council in January 1892 . In June 1892 , he settled a dispute between the Trades and Labour Council and the Labour Party and as a result became the president of the council and chairman of the party . In 1893 and 1894 , he worked hard to resolve the debate over the solidarity pledge and established the Labour Partys basic practices , including the sovereignty of the party conference , caucus solidarity , the pledge required of parliamentarians and the powerful role of the extra-parliamentary executive . At the 1894 colonial election which saw the defeat of the Protectionist Party government , Watson was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the country seat of Young . At the 1895 colonial election the incumbent Free Trade Party minority government led by Premier George Reid increased their support but remained several seats short of a majority . Labour at this time had a policy of support in return for concessions , and Watson voted with his colleagues to strategically provide such legislative support to the incumbent government . Following the 1898 colonial election , despite a significant swing against the incumbent government , Watson and Labour leader James McGowen decided to allow the incumbent government to remain so that it could complete the work of establishing the Federation of Australia . Federation . Watson was involved in shaping party policy regarding the movement for Federation from 1895 , and was one of ten Labour candidates nominated for the Australasian Federal Convention on 4 March 1897 , but none of these candidates managed to be elected . The party endorsed Federation , but nevertheless most leading party figures viewed the draft Commonwealth Constitution as undemocratic , and believed that the Senate as proposed was much too powerful , similar to the anti-reformist Colonial state upper houses and the UK House of Lords . When the draft was submitted to a referendum on 3 June 1898 , Labour opposed it , with Watson prominent in the campaign , and saw the referendum rejected . Watson was devoted to the idea of the referendum as an ideal feature of democracy . To ensure that Reid might finally bring New South Wales into national union on an amended draft constitution , Watson helped to negotiate a deal , involving the party executive , that included the nomination of four Labour members to the New South Wales Legislative Council . At the March 1899 annual party conference , Billy Hughes and Holman moved to have those arrangements nullified and party policy on Federation changed , thus thwarting Reids plans . Although rarely known to resort to anger , on this occasion Watson jumped to his feet in a most excited manner and in heated tones .. . contended .. . that they should not interfere with the referendum . The motion was lost and the four party men were nominated to the council on 4 April . The bill approving the second referendum , to be held on 20 June 1899 , was passed on 20 April . Labour leaders , including Watson opposed the final terms of the Commonwealth Constitution . Nonetheless , they could not stop it from going ahead , and Watson , unlike Holman and Hughes , believed that it should be submitted to the people . Nevertheless , Watson joined all but two of the Labour parliamentarians in campaigning against the Yes vote at the referendum . When the Constitution was accepted , he agreed that the mandate of the majority will have to be obeyed . Federal parliament . Watson was elected to the new federal Parliament of Australia at the inaugural 1901 federal election , representing the rural House of Representatives rural seat of Bland . Watson arrived in Melbourne , which at the time served as the temporary seat of government , in May 1901 . Watson was elected the first leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party ( usually known as the Caucus ) on 8 May 1901 , the day before the opening of the parliament . Watson pursued the same policy as Labor had done in New South Wales , where Labor was the smallest of the three parties but held the balance of power . Under Watson , Labor provided confidence and supply to the Protectionist Party minority governments of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin in exchange for legislation enacting the Labour platform , such as the immensely popular White Australia policy which left the free Trade Party led by George Reid to form the opposition . Watson , as a Labor moderate , genuinely admired Deakin and shared his liberal views on many subjects . Deakin reciprocated this sentiment . Deakin wrote in one of his anonymous articles in a London newspaper that The Labour section has much cause for gratitude to Mr Watson , the leader whose tact and judgement have enabled it to achieve many of its Parliamentary successes . White Australia . Watson was a white nationalist and white supremacist who played a key role in the creation of the White Australia policy . According to , the ideal of a white Australia stood at the centre of Watsons political ideology , a touchstone of Australian identity that Watson repeatedly stressed in interviews , speeches and articles . However , some of his biographers have noted that his racial views were widespread among Australians at the time and that all three major parties supported White Australia . During the debate over what became the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 , Watson stated that the issue of racial purity was the larger and more important one for the passage of the bill , where some speakers had emphasised concerns over the economic impact of cheap foreign labour . He opposed the governments dictation test provision on the grounds that it could be easily circumvented , and that education does not eliminate the objectionable qualities of the Baboo Hindoo . He instead sought to explicitly ban any Asian or African from entering Australia . During the same debate he spoke of racial contamination and referred to Chinese people using a racial slur , rhetorically asking whether we would desire that our sisters or our brothers should be married into any of these races to which we object . In 1905 , Watson drafted a new plank for the ALP platform calling for an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity . He successfully moved for its adoption at both state and federal conferences , stating that the party should cleanse their own doorstep with the hope that thus the street would be cleansed . Prime Minister in 1904 . Labour under Watson doubled their vote at the 1903 federal election and continued to hold the balance of power despite all three parties holding about the same number of seats . In April 1904 , however , Watson and Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to cover state public servants , the fallout causing Deakin to resign . Reid declined to take office , which saw Watson become the first Labour Prime Minister of Australia , the worlds first Labour head of government at a national level ( Anderson Dawson had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899 ) , indeed the worlds first socialist or social democratic government at a national level . He was aged only 37 , and remains the youngest Prime Minister in Australias history . Billy Hughes later recalled the first meeting of the Labour Cabinet with characteristic sharp wit : Despite the apparent fitness of the new Prime Minister for his role , the government hung on the fine thread of Deakins promise of fair play . The triumph of the historic first Australian Labour government was a qualified one – Labour did not have the numbers to implement key policies . The three elevens – the lack of a definite majority in the parliament after the second federal election – dogged Watson just as it had Deakin . Six bills were enacted during Watsons brief government . All but one – an amended Acts Interpretation Act 1904 – were supply bills . The most significant legislative achievement of the Watson government was the advancement of the troublesome Conciliation and Arbitration Bill . Another accomplishment was the appointing of a Royal Commission on a Bill related to Navigation and Shipping , whose report ( presented a couple of years later ) led to major redrafting of the Navigation Act and improvements in conditions for Australian seamen . Once he became the Prime Minister Watson recognized the limitations of his position in the Labour caucus and endorsed the concept of a deputy leader . Andrew Fisher won the position by one vote over the more dynamic Billy Hughes . Defeat and final years as leader . Although Watson sought a dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held , the Governor-General Lord Northcote refused . Unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives , Watson resigned the premiership less than four months after taking office , his term ending on 18 August 1904 ( Deakin was later defeated on a similar bill ) . Reid became Prime Minister and four months later his government managed to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill after compromising to extend the scope to state public servants as Watson had proposed . Deakin again became Prime Minister after Reid lost confidence of the parliament in July 1905 . Watson led Labour to the 1906 federal election and improved their position again . At this election the seat of Bland was abolished , so he shifted to the seat of South Sydney . But in October 1907 , recognising his work for the foundation of the parliamentary party was complete and also due to fatigue and concern over the health of his wife Ada , he resigned the Labour leadership in favour of Andrew Fisher . Watson retired from politics , aged only 42 , prior to the 1910 federal election , at which Labour won with 50 percent of the primary vote . It was the first time a party had been elected to majority government in the House of Representatives , it was also the first time a party won a Senate majority , and it was the worlds first Labour Party majority government at a national level . The ALP vote had risen rapidly , going from 15 percent against two larger and more established parties in 1901 , to 50 percent in 1910 , after a majority of the Protectionist Party merged with the Anti-Socialist Party , creating the Commonwealth Liberal Party which received 45 percent . Later life . Political activities . In the Australian Labor Party split of 1916 , numerous Labor MPs were expelled from the party for supporting World War I conscription in Australia . Watson sided with ex-Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes and the conscriptionists and had his party membership terminated as a result . Watson remained active in the affairs of Hughes Nationalist Party until 1922 , but after that he drifted out of politics altogether . In 1931 he was state president of the Australian Industries Protection League and supported the Scullin Governments high-tariff policies . Business activities . In December 1910 , Watson was recruited by a syndicate of Sydney businessmen to lead a gold-seeking expedition in South Africa . He also engaged in land speculation in Sutherland , but development did not occur rapidly enough . He was appointed as a director of Labor Papers Limited , the publisher of the AWUs official newspaper The Australian Worker . Watson joined the council of the newly established National Roads Association ( NRA ) in March 1920 , and in August was elected as the associations inaugural president . The NRA was intended as a peak body for New South Wales motorists , lobbying the state government to create a Main Roads Board and borrow money to improve local highways . It was initially hampered by its small membership and lack of financial resources , with a budget of only £15 per week . Watson was able to attract publicity through the launch of a magazine and a successful campaign to raise speed limits . He was again chosen as president in 1923 when the NRA was reorganised into the National Roads and Motorists Association ( NRMA ) , and would retain the position for the rest of his life . By the end of the following year the organisation had grown from 550 to 5,000 members . It subsequently expanded into vehicle insurance and motor touring , acquiring a series of properties for camping . As well as his involvement with the NRMA , Watson also served as a director of a taxi company , Yellow Cabs of Australia Ltd. , and as chairman of the state governments Traffic Advisory Committee . In 1936 he became the inaugural chairman of petrol retailer Ampol . Personal life . Watsons first wife Ada died in 1921 . On 30 October 1925 he married Antonia Mary Gladys Dowlan in the same church as his first wedding . She was a 23-year-old waitress from Western Australia whom he had met when she served his table at a Sydney club . In 1927 , they had one daughter , Jacqueline Dunn née Watson . Watson and his second wife moved to a villa in Double Bay in 1934 . In retirement he became a keen bridge player and was also a regular attendee at Randwick Racecourse and the Sydney Cricket Ground , serving on the SCG Trust . He visited the United States for business reasons and also returned to New Zealand on a number of occasions in a private capacity . After several weeks of ill health , Watson died at his home in Double Bay on 18 November 1941 , aged 74 . He was granted a state funeral at St Andrews Cathedral , with Joseph Cook , Albert Gardiner , John Curtin and William McKell serving as pallbearers . His ashes were interred at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium . Evaluation and honours . According to Percival Serle , Watson left a much greater impression on his time than this would suggest . He came at the right moment for his party , and nothing could have done it more good than the sincerity , courtesy and moderation which he always showed as a leader . Alfred Deakin wrote of Watson : The Labour section has much cause for gratitude to Mr Watson , the leader whose tact and judgement have enabled it to achieve many of its Parliamentary successes . In April 2004 the Labor Party marked the centenary of the Watson Government with a series of public events in Canberra and Melbourne , attended by then party leader Mark Latham and former ALP Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam , Bob Hawke and Paul Keating .

Its headquarters are located in Shiodome City Center in the Shiodome area of Minato ward of Tokyo . It operates services to both domestic and international destinations and had more than 20,000 employees as of March 2016 . In May 2010 , ANAs total passenger traffic was up year-on-year by 7.8% , and its international services grew by 22% to 2.07 million passengers in the first five months of 2010 . In addition to its mainline operations , ANA controls several subsidiary passenger carriers , including its regional airline , ANA Wings , Air Nippon , Air Do ( a low-cost carrier operating scheduled service between Tokyo and cities in Hokkaido ) , and Allex Cargo ( ANA Cargo - the freighter division operated by Air Japan ) . ANA is also the largest shareholder in Peach , a low-cost carrier joint venture with Hong Kong company First Eastern Investment Group . In October 1999 , the airline became a member of Star Alliance . On 29 March 2013 , ANA was named a 5-Star Airline by Skytrax . On 27 April 2018 , ANA announced ANA Business Jet Co. , Ltd. , a joint venture with Sojitz to offer private jet charter flights . History . Formation . ANAs earliest ancestor was ( also known as Nippon Helicopter and Aeroplane ) , an airline company founded on 27 December 1952 . Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANAs International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) airline code , NH . NH began helicopter services in February 1953 . On 15 December 1953 , it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove , JA5008 . This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan . Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954 , and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March . In 1955 , Douglas DC-3s began flying for NH as well , by which time the airlines route network extended from northern Kyūshū to Sapporo . In December 1957 Nippon Helicopter changed its name to All Nippon Airways Company . ANAs other ancestor was . Although it was founded on 26 December 1952 , one day before Nippon Helicopter , it did not begin operations until 20 January 1954 , when it began night cargo runs between Osaka and Tokyo , also using a de Havilland Dove . It adopted the DC-3 in early 1957 , by which point its route network extended through southern Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima . Far East Airlines merged with the newly named All Nippon Airways in March 1958 . The combined companies had a total market capitalization of 600 million yen , and the result of the merger was Japans largest private airline . The merged airline received a new Japanese name ( ; ; Japan Air Transport ) . The company logo of the larger NH was selected as the logo of the new combined airline , and the new carrier operated a route network combined from its two predecessors . Domestic era . ANA grew through the 1960s , adding the Vickers Viscount to the fleet in 1960 and the Fokker F27 in 1961 . October 1961 marked ANAs debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as well as the Osaka Securities Exchange . 1963 saw another merger , with Fujita Airlines , raising the companys capital to 4.65 billion yen . In 1965 ANA introduced jets with Boeing 727s on the Tokyo-Sapporo route . It also introduced Japans first homegrown turboprop airliner , the NAMC YS-11 in 1965 , replacing Convair 440s on local routes . In 1969 , ANA introduced Boeing 737 services . As ANA grew it started to contract travel companies across Japan to handle ground services in each region . Many of these companies received shares in ANA as part of their deals . Some of these relationships continue today in different forms : for instance , Nagoya Railroad , which handled ANAs operations in the Chūbu region along with other partnerships , maintains a permanent seat on ANAs board of directors . By 1974 , ANA had Japans largest domestic airline network . While ANAs domestic operations grew , the Ministry of Transport had granted government-owned Japan Airlines ( JAL ) a monopoly on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986 . ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights : its first was a Boeing 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on 21 February 1971 . ANA bought its first widebody aircraft , six Lockheed L-1011s , in November 1971 , following a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon , Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka and UK prime minister Edward Heath ( lobbying in favor of engine maker Rolls-Royce ) . Tanaka also pressed Japanese regulators to permit ANA to operate on Asia routes as part of the package . The aircraft entered service on the Tokyo-Okinawa route in 1974 . The carrier had ordered McDonnell Douglas DC-10s but cancelled the order at the last minute and switched to Lockheed . It was later revealed that Lockheed had indirectly bribed Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to force this switch : the scandal led to the arrest of Tanaka and several managers from ANA and Lockheed sales agent Marubeni for corruption . Boeing 747-200s were introduced on the Tokyo-Sapporo and Tokyo-Fukuoka routes in 1976 and Boeing 767s in 1983 on Shikoku routes . The carriers first B747s were the short-range SR variant , designed for Japanese domestic routes . International era . In 1986 , ANA began to expand beyond Japans key domestic carrier to become a competitive international carrier as well . On 3 March 1986 , ANA started scheduled international flights with a passenger service from Tokyo to Guam . Flights to Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , followed by years end , and ANA also entered a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carriers new flights to Narita . ANA expanded its international services gradually : to Beijing , Dalian , Hong Kong and Sydney in 1987 ; to Seoul in 1988 ; to London and Saipan in 1989 ; to Paris in 1990 and to New York and Singapore in 1991 . Airbus equipment such as the A320 and A321 was added to the fleet in the early 1990s , as was the Boeing 747-400 jet . ANA joined the Star Alliance in October 1999 . 2004 saw ANAs profits exceed JALs for the first time . That year , facing a surplus of slots due to the construction of new airports and the ongoing expansion of Tokyo International Airport , ANA announced a fleet renewal plan that would replace some of its large aircraft with a greater number of smaller aircraft . Also in 2004 , ANA set up low-cost subsidiary Air Next to operate flights from Fukuoka Airport starting in 2005 , and became the majority shareholder in Nakanihon Airline Service ( NAL ) headquartered in Nagoya Airport . In 2005 , ANA renamed NAL to Air Central , and relocated its headquarters to Chūbu Centrair International Airport . On 12 July 2005 , ANA reached a deal with NYK to sell its 27.6% share in Nippon Cargo Airlines , a joint venture formed between the two companies in 1987 . The sale allowed ANA to focus on developing its own cargo division . In 2006 , ANA , Japan Post , Nippon Express , and Mitsui O.S.K . Lines founded ANA &amp; JP Express ( AJV ) , which would operate freighters . ANA is the top shareholder of AJV . It absorbed Air Japans freighter operations . Air Transport World named ANA its 2007 Airline of the Year . In 2006 , the airline was recognized by FlightOnTime.info as the most punctual scheduled airline between London and Tokyo for the last four consecutive years , based on official British statistics . Japan Airlines took over the title in 2007 . In 2009 , ANA announced plans to test an idea as part of the airlines e-flight campaign , encouraging passengers on select flights to visit the airport restroom before they board . On 10 November of the same year , ANA also announced Inspiration of Japan , ANAs newest international flight concept , with redesigned cabins initially launched on its 777-300ER aircraft . In July 2011 , All Nippon Airways and AirAsia agreed to form a low-cost carrier , called AirAsia Japan , based at Tokyos Narita International Airport . ANA held 51 percent shares and AirAsia held 33 percent voting shares and 16 percent non-voting shares through its wholly owned subsidiary , AA International . The carrier lasted until October 2013 , when AirAsia withdrew from the joint venture ; the carrier was subsequently rebranded as Vanilla Air .

ANA will also introduce a new lounge ( which opened on 20 February 2010 , supposed to be in coincidence with the introduction of new aircraft interiors but delayed [ see below ] ) and check-in concept ( later in autumn 2010 ) at Narita for first class and ANA Mileage Clubs Diamond Service elite members . The introduction of the concept also discontinued the use of the name Club ANA , which was used for its international business class seats ( changing into a generic business class name ) as well as the name of the lounges ( all lounges for both first class and business class are named ANA Lounge , with the first class lounge called the ANA Suite Lounge and its arrival lounge the ANA Arrival Lounge ) . This Inspiration of Japan concept was originally set to debut on 20 February 2010 with the delivery of its new Boeing 777-300ER prior to that date , followed by the introduction of the concept on that date on the Narita-New York route . However , due to delays to the new premium economy seats , the debut was pushed back to 19 April . ( The delay was due to the failure of a safety test in Japan of a new seat design axle , made by seat manufacturer Koito Industries Ltd . This safety test failure also affected deliveries of aircraft to be operated by three other fellow Star Alliance members – Singapore Airlines for its A380s , Thai Airways A330s , and Continental Airlines for new 737-800 deliveries. ) The Inspiration of Japan concept has been refitted on its existing 777-300ERs for service on all the airlines North American routes , and may be refitted on its European routes .

Three years later he was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Urban VIII and was installed as Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina and appointed Bishop of Venice . His elevation was not without controversy as the Republic of Venice prohibited any son of a Doge from accepting a papal appointment . Eventually , the Venetian senate approved the promotion but refused to approve his proposed appointments as Bishop of Vicenza or Bishop of Padua .

He was a first choice player throughout almost all his time there as he helped the side win promotion to the top flight via the playoffs in 2003 , and played for a season at that level before spending two further seasons in the second tier attempting to win promotion back . By 2006 , Camerons time at Molineux was over , not featuring in manager Glenn Hoddles future plans at the club .

He was capped 28 times by Scotland , scoring twice . He made his international debut on 28 April 1999 , in a 1–0 friendly win in Germany . Cameron was brought up in the Links area of Kirkcaldy , very close to Starks Park , the ground of Raith Rovers . He attended Balwearie High School in Kirkcaldy until December 1988 and then joined Raith Rovers . Cameron spent most of the 1991–92 season on loan to Irish side Sligo Rovers , before becoming a regular in the Raith side . He was part of the team who famously defeated Celtic on penalties to win the 1994–95 League Cup . The following season , he played in both legs of the 1995–96 UEFA Cup tie against Bayern Munich . Tasting two titles ( and a relegation in-between ) , Cameron made just over 150 league appearances for Rovers before leaving in March 1996 . Cameron moved to Wolves in a £1.75m deal in August 2001 . Cameron was a fans favourite at Wolves , mainly because of his effort and determination . With 23 goals in 168 appearances , Cameron was not a regular goalscorer but contributed some important goals , including the goal that gave the club their first ever Premier League victory in a 1–0 success over Manchester City , and Wolves never lost a match in which he scored . He was a first choice player throughout almost all his time there as he helped the side win promotion to the top flight via the playoffs in 2003 , and played for a season at that level before spending two further seasons in the second tier attempting to win promotion back .</p><p>pred_time: Sligo Rovers</p><p>groundtruth: Heart of Midlothian</p></div><button class="collapsible">idx-266"/wiki/The_News_Quiz#P371#0</button><div class="content">idx: /wiki/The_News_Quiz#P371#0<p>context: The News Quiz The News Quiz is a British topical panel game broadcast on BBC Radio 4 . History . The News Quiz was first broadcast in 1977 with Barry Norman as chairman . Subsequently , it was chaired by Barry Took from 1979 to 1981 , Simon Hoggart from 1981 to 1986 , Barry Took again from 1986 to 1995 , and then again by Simon Hoggart from 1996 until March 2006 . Hoggart was replaced by Sandi Toksvig in September 2006 , who in turn was replaced by Miles Jupp in September 2015 until his departure at the end of 2019 . Three different hosts took the chair in 2020 , Nish Kumar ( series 101 ) , Angela Barnes ( series 102 ) , and Andy Zaltzman ( series 103 ) . At the end of series 103 it was announced that Zaltzman would continue as permanent host . The series was created by John Lloyd based on an idea from Nicholas Parsons . Originally Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams and Punch editor Alan Coren acted as team captains . It was adapted for television in 1981 under the title Scoop , running for two series , and later inspired the television programme Have I Got News for You . In 2012 the BBC piloted an American version hosted by Lewis Black . On 28 June 2013 , the News Quiz paid tribute to Radio 4 announcer Rory Morrison , who used to read the news cuttings on the programme . During series 97 , running from August to October 2018 , Jupp was absent due to filming commitments overseas , so show regulars Simon Evans , Susan Calman , Fred MacAulay , Bridget Christie , Jo Brand and Lucy Porter took turns in the hosts seat . Jupp himself chaired the first and last episodes of the series . In May 2019 it was announced that Jupp would leave the show at the end of the 99th series at the end of the month . Series 100 had several hosts : Nish Kumar , Angela Barnes , Andy Zaltzman , Phil Wang , Kiri Pritchard-McLean , Zoe Lyons , Patrick Kielty and Andrew Maxwell . The hosts for 2020 are Nish Kumar , Angela Barnes and Andy Zaltzman . Zaltzman was named as the permanent host at the conclusion of series 103 . Transmission . The programme is usually recorded in front of an audience on Thursday evenings at the BBC Radio Theatre at Broadcasting House in central London . It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30 , then repeated on the Saturday lunchtime . The final 28 minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording . In 2012 the BBC began making an extended version for BBC Radio 4 Extra . Each week , four panellists appear on the show . They are usually either comedians or journalists , and sometimes politicians . Journalists predominated in the early years . The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events . However this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered . The participants frequently wander off topic . The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to , usually with a scripted comic punchline , before asking the next question . It is not uncommon for the show to get through only two rounds of the panel before the final section is reached . Before the host announces the largely symbolic scores , the panellists read out statements from newspapers and other media which they find amusing . Personnel . Current host . In 2020 , Andy Zaltzman guest hosted series 103 and at the end of the run was announced as the new permanent host .

Before joining Spotify he led Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris . He is one of the pioneers of computer music closely linked to artificial intelligence , especially in the field of machine improvisation and style modelling . He has been elected ECCAI Fellow in 2014 . Education . Pachet graduated from École des ponts ParisTech in Civil Engineering , and Computer Science in 1987 , majoring Applied Mathematics . He spent 18 months as lecturer at Kuala Lumpur at the University of Malaya in 1987–1988 . He obtained a PhD from Pierre and Marie Curie University in Computer Science , ( His thesis was Knowledge representation with objects and rules : the NéOpus system , supervised by Jean-François Perrot ) . He spent 1 year as post-doc in Montréal at Université du Québec à Montréal , where he worked on the Cyc project Common sense representation , Douglas Lenat , MCC ) , with the help of Hafedh Mili professor at UQAM . In 1997 , he got his habilitation diploma on the subject : Object-oriented languages and knowledge representation at University Pierre et Marie Curie . He was auditeur at the 58th national session of Institut des Hautes Etudes en Défense Nationale , in 2006 , and was appointed Colonel in 2007 in the réserve citoyenne ( French Air Force ) . Experiences . In 1993 , he was appointed Assistant Professor ( in French , Maitre de conférences ) , at Pierre and Marie Curie University until 1997 in Computer Science , Research and Teaching . In 1997 , Pachet moved to Sony-CSL ( Computer Science Laboratory ) Paris . He started a research activity on music and artificial intelligence . His team has authored and pioneered many technologies ( about 35 patents ) about electronic music distribution , audio feature extraction and music interaction . He was appointed director of Sony Computer Science Laboratories in 2014 . The CSL ( the branch of Sony-CSL Tokyo ) is dedicated to basic research in computer science ; it was created by Luc Steels and Mario Tokoro in 1996 . Since 2017 , he is director of Spotifys Creator Research Technology Lab in Paris , where he develops tools for assisting music creation . Achievements . The Music team at Sony Computer Science Laboratory Paris was founded in 1997 by Pachet , where he developed the vision that metadata can greatly enhance the musical experience , from listening to performance . The Flow Composer is his second achievement , a system to compose lead sheets in the style of arbitrary composers . It was followed by LSDB , the first collecting lead sheets in electronic format with a large-scale effort ( Over 11,000 lead sheets collected ) ; and Virtuoso , a solo jazz detector . The Popular Music Browser project , which started in 1998 , at Sony Computer Science Laboratories This research project covers all areas of the music‐to‐listener chain , from music description , descriptor extraction from the music signal , or data mining techniques , Similarity‐based access , and novel music retrieval methods such as automatic sequence generation , and to user interface issues . Moreover , he has designed the Continuator , a system allowing real-time musical improvisation with an algorithm . He is now the beneficiary of the ERC Grant Flow Machines for investigating how machines can boost creativity in humans and be able to continue a work in the same musical style . Pachet wants a future in which consumers could buy the unique style of an artist and apply it to their own material ; he says , I call it Stylistic Cryogenics -- to freeze the style into an object that can be reused and made alive again . The MusicSpace is a spatialization control system created with O . Delerue in 2000 . Another achievement is CUIDADO ( Content-based Unified Interfaces and Descriptors for Audio/music Databases available Online ) , a two-year project ended in 2003 , on developing content-based , audio modules and applications ; the project includes the analysis , the navigation and creative process . This project is satisfying the needs of record labels and copyright societies for Information management methods , for marketing and for protecting their informations , using an Authoring system using content features for professional musicians and studios . Moreover , in 2014 , Pachet presented two music tutorials on Brazilian guitar and Jazz . His most notable achievement is the Continuator , an interactive music improvisation system . Experimented with many professional musicians , presented notably at the SIGGRAPH’03 conference and considered a reference in the domain of music interaction , an example of a Musical Turing test with the Continuator on VPRO Channel with Jazz Pianist jazz Albert van Veenendaal ( Amsterdam ) . ARTE presents Pachet on Square Idée Demain , devenir Wagner ou Daft Punk? , ( Tomorrow , become Wagner or Daft Punk? ) October 2015 .

A former Liberal Member of Parliament ( MP ) , McCallum was the Canadian Ambassador to China from 2017 to 2019 . He was asked for his resignation by Prime Minister Trudeau in 2019 . As an MP , he represented the electoral district of Markham—Thornhill , and had previously represented Markham—Unionville and Markham . He is a member of the Queens Privy Council for Canada . A veteran federal politician who began his political career in 2000 , McCallum has served in the governments of Liberal prime ministers Jean Chrétien , Paul Martin , and Justin Trudeau . McCallum has previously been Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Minister of National Defence , Minister of Veterans Affairs , and Minister of Immigration , Refugees and Citizenship . Early life and education . McCallum was born in Montreal , Quebec , the son of Joan ( Patteson ) and Alexander Campbell McCallum . He received his secondary education at Selwyn House School and Trinity College School . He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queens College , Cambridge University , a from Université de Paris I and a PhD degree in economics from McGill University . Academic career ( 1976–1994 ) . McCallum was a professor of economics at the University of Manitoba from 1976 until 1978 , Simon Fraser University from 1978 until 1982 , the Université du Québec à Montréal from 1982 until 1987 , and McGill University from 1987 until 1994 . He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada , student . He was also Dean of the Faculty of Arts at McGill University , when his future boss , Justin Trudeau was a student there . He then became Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist of the Royal Bank of Canada . One of his most influential academic contributions was an article in The American Economic Review , which introduced the concept of the home bias in trade puzzle . It has spawned an ongoing international debate on whether trade within a nation state is greater than trade among nations , as compared with the predictions of standard economic models . As McGill Universitys Dean of Arts , McCallum secured a $10 million contribution from Charles Bronfman for the establishment of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada . He also participated in the national unity debates of the early 1990s , editing the Canada Round Series of the C . D . Howe Institute and engaging in debate with then Opposition Leader Jacques Parizeau at Quebecs National Assembly . Private sector career ( 1994–2000 ; 2019 onward ) . McCallum was the Royal Bank of Canadas chief economist for six years . He consistently achieved the highest media coverage of bank chief economists , making regular appearances on CBCs The National as an economics panellist . He also engaged in social issues , notably a 1997 Royal Bank conference designed to align the business community with the recommendations of the 1996 Report on the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples . His paper at that conference , The Cost of Doing Nothing , was highlighted ten years later in the Aboriginal Times magazine . In July 2020 , McCullums employment by the Wailian Group , a Chinese company that assists with immigration to Canada , sparked calls from oppositions MPs and Democracy Watch for McCullum to be investigated by the Ethics Commissioner for potential breaches of the Conflict of Interest Act . Political career . Member of Parliament ( 2000–2017 ) . McCallum successfully nominated Nelson Mandela as the second honorary citizen in Canadian history . McCallum was quite vocal in Canadas debate on same-sex marriage . He told the Edmonton Sun in August 2003 , If people want to do something and it doesnt hurt other people , doesnt reduce other peoples rights , we should let them do it . Why not ? He also significantly contributed to the final debate before the vote on same-sex marriage on 21 March 2005 saying : I believe we should always seek to expand the rights of our fellow citizens as long as we do not thereby reduce the rights of others . We should seek to ensure that no group is denied full participation in society . As members of Parliament , we should not ask the question , why should we extend this right ? Rather our question should be , why should we not extend the right ? Let the burden of proof be on those who wish to limit fundamental rights . Many Canadians will want to accept both of these principles : protect the traditional definition of marriage and protect the rights of minorities . The essence of my message today is that we cannot do both . We cannot have it both ways . We must make a choice between traditional marriage and the protection of minority rights . Defence Minister ( 2002–2003 ) . As Defence Minister under Jean Chrétien , McCallum achieved what was then the largest increase in the annual defence budget ( $1 billion ) in more than a decade in return for offering up $200 million in savings from reducing low priority spending . He also retroactively reversed an inequity which awarded up to $250,000 to military personnel who lost their eyesight or a limb while on active service - but only to those with the rank of colonel or above . Now all Canadian Forces members are covered by the plan regardless of rank . Working with Germany , he successfully persuaded NATO to take control over the security mission in Kabul , Afghanistan , while also ensuring that the mission was led by Canada . He also determined that the army , rather than the navy or air force , was to be the top priority in budget allocations . He became widely known and criticized in 2002 when he admitted , while serving as the Minister of National Defence , that he had never heard of the 1942 Dieppe raid , a fateful and nationally significant operation for Canadian Forces during the Second World War . Ironically , he wrote a letter to the editor of the National Post in response , but committed a further gaffe , confusing Canadian participation in the 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge in France with Vichy France from 1940 to 1944 . Response at the continued historical ignorance prompted outrage and humour among the press . In November 2002 , while still serving as Defence Minister , McCallum encountered further controversy when officials refused to allow him to board an Air Canada flight because his breath smelt heavily of alcohol . McCallum announced soon thereafter that the incident prompted him to abstain completely from alcohol consumption . He reportedly also intended to lose weight and give up smoking . In January 2003 , McCallum suggested Canadian troops could avoid so-called friendly fire incidents by wearing some of female Conservative MP Elsie Waynes clothes . McCallum later apologized both inside and outside the House of Commons for using inappropriate language , blaming the excitement of the moment , and had his apologies accepted by Wayne . Veterans Affairs Minister ( 2003–2004 ) . Under Paul Martin , McCallum introduced a new charter for younger , postwar veterans who have been physically or mentally injured while serving in the Canadian Forces . This charter , which became law in 2005 , is modelled on the range of services provided for returning veterans after World War II . This new model stripped veterans of a monthly pension opting for a lump sum payment . Revenue Minister ( 2004–2006 ) . As Minister of National Revenue and Chair of the Cabinets Expenditure Review Committee , McCallum achieved in 2005 expenditure reductions of $11 billion over the next five years . Shadow Cabinet Immigration Critic ( 2006–2015 ) . When the Conservatives came to power in January 2006 under Stephen Harper , McCallum was appointed as the Immigration Critic . Immigration Minister ( 2015–2017 ) . On 4 November 2015 , he was appointed the Minister of Immigration , Refugees and Citizenship in the newly elected 29th Canadian Ministry of Justin Trudeau . As a senior cabinet minister , McCallum was then fourth in line in case of the PMs incapacity . As Immigration Minister , he oversaw the intake of Syrian refugees during the Syrian refugee crisis . Ambassador to China ( 2017–2019 ) . On 10 January 2017 , it was announced that McCallum would be appointed as Canadas Ambassador to China . This resulted in a cabinet reshuffle as he stepped down from his position as the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship to pursue his new post . McCallum expressed eagerness to take on the posting in Beijing , citing his strong personal connections to China , as his former riding Markham has primarily Chinese constituents and both his wife and children are of Chinese ethnicity . On 23 January 2019 , McCallum spoke to Chinese-language Canadian and state-owned Chinese media in Markham , Ontario , concerning the detainment and extradition request by the United States , which resulted in the arrest of Huawei deputy chairwoman Meng Wanzhou , who was awaiting court judgement . The United States alleges that Meng Wanzhou is in violation of the United States Sanctions against Iran and the Canadian Federal government reaffirms that they are obligated to follow judicial protocol and that the arrest is not political in nature . McCallum shared his thoughts with the media by restating public facts that could make Mengs legal defence case strong against this extradition request . This included President Donald Trumps political intrusion , which undermined the integrity of the Canadian judicial protocol , thereby contradicting Canadas stance by making it political in nature . Furthermore , McCallum re-stated other well-reported motives the United States could have , citing the alleged intent of the arrest by the United States was to attempt to obtain trade concessions from China . McCallum withdrew his comments , saying he misspoke and that they did not accurately represent position on this issue . That week , McCallum is further quoted as later telling a Toronto Star journalist it would be great for Canada if the US extradition request were dropped , conditional on release of Canadians since detained in China . On 26 January 2019 , McCallum submitted his resignation as ambassador to China , at the request of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , who did not disclose the reasoning behind this decision . Family . He is married to Malaysian Chinese Nancy Lim ( ) and has three sons ( Andrew , Jamie , and Duncan ) .</p><p>question: John McCallum was an employee for whom from 1994 to 2000?</p><p>pred: Royal Bank of Canadas</p><p>context_time: A veteran federal politician who began his political career in 2000 , McCallum has served in the governments of Liberal prime ministers Jean Chrétien , Paul Martin , and Justin Trudeau .

The modern Russian Air Force was originally established on 7 May 1992 following Boris Yeltsins creation of the Ministry of Defence ; however , the Russian Federations air force can trace its lineage and traditions back to the Imperial Russian Air Service ( 1912–1917 ) and the Soviet Air Forces ( 1918–1991 ) . The Russian Navy has its own independent air arm , the Russian Naval Aviation , which is the former Soviet Aviatsiya Voyenno-morskogo Flota ( lit . Aviation of the military-sea fleet ) , or AVMF . History . 1991–2000 . Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union into its fifteen constituent republics in December 1991 , the aircraft and personnel of the Soviet Air Forces—the VVS were divided among the newly independent states . General Pyotr Deynekin , the former deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet Air Forces , became the first commander of the new organisation on 24 August 1991 . Russia received the majority of the most modern fighters and 65% of the manpower . The major commands of the former Soviet VVS—the Long-Range Aviation , Military Transport Aviation and Frontal Aviation were renamed , with few changes , Russian VVS commands . However , many regiments , aircraft , and personnel were claimed by the republics they were based in , forming the core of the new republics air forces . Some aircraft in Belarus and Ukraine ( such as Tupolev Tu-160s ) were returned to Russia , sometimes in return for debt reductions , as well as a long-range aviation division based at Dolon in Kazakhstan . During the 1990s , the financial stringency was felt throughout the armed forces made its mark on the Russian Air Forces as well . Pilots and other personnel could sometimes not get their wages for months , and on occasion resorted to desperate measures : four MiG-31 pilots at Yelizovo in the Far East went on hunger strike in 1996 to demand back pay which was several months overdue , and the problem was only resolved by diverting unit money intended for other tasks . As a result of the cutbacks , infrastructure became degraded as well , and in 1998 , 40% of military airfields needed repair . The VVS participated in the First Chechen War ( 1994–1996 ) and the Second Chechen War ( 1999–2002 ) . These campaigns also presented significant difficulties for the VVS including the terrain , lack of significant fixed targets and insurgents armed with Stinger and Strela-2M surface-to-air missiles . The former Soviet Air Defence Forces remained independent for several years under Russian control , only merging with the Air Forces in 1998 . The decree merging the two forces was issued by President Boris Yeltsin on 16 July 1997 . During 1998 altogether 580 units and formations were disbanded , 134 reorganised , and over 600 given a new jurisdiction . The redistribution of forces affected 95% of aircraft , 98% of helicopters , 93% of anti-aircraft missile complexes , 95% of the equipment of radiotechnical troops , 100% of anti-aircraft missiles and over 60% of aviation armament . More than 600,000 tons of material changed location and 3,500 aircraft changed airfields . Military Transport Aviation planes took more than 40,000 families to new residence areas . The short-lived operational commands were abolished . Two air armies , the 37th Air Army ( long-range aviation ) and the 61st Air Army ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , were established directly under the Supreme Command . The former frontal aviation and anti-aircraft forces were organised as Air Force Armies and Anti-Aircraft Defense Armies under the military district commanders . There were initially four such armies with headquarters in St.Petersburg ( Leningrad Military District ) , Rostov-on-Don ( North Caucasus Military District ) , Khabarovsk ( Far East Military District ) , and Chita ( Siberian Military District ) . Two military districts had separate Air and Air Defence Corps . When the Transbaikal Military District and Siberian Military District were merged , the 14th Air Army was reactivated to serve as the air force formation in the area . The number of servicemen in the air force was reduced to about 185,000 from the former combined number of 318,000 . 123,500 positions were abolished , including almost 1,000 colonel positions . The resignation of 3000 other servicemen included 46 generals of which 15 were colonel generals . On 29 December 1998 Colonel General Anatoly Kornukov , a former Air Defence Forces officer and new commander-in-chief of the merged force , succeeding Deynekin , reported to the Russian defence minister that the task had in principle been achieved . General Kornukov established the new headquarters of the force in Zarya , near Balashikha , 20 km east of the centre of Moscow , in the former PVO central command post , where the CIS common air defence system is directed from . 2001–2010 . In 1999 Vladimir Putin became Prime Minister of Russia and then President in 2000 ; he continued to hold one or the other of these offices through every year since . In December 2003 the aviation assets of the Russian Ground Forces—mostly helicopters—were transferred to the VVS , following the shooting down of a Mi-26 helicopter in Chechnya on 19 August 2002 , that claimed 19 lives . The former Army Aviation was in its previous form intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces , by providing their tactical air support , conducting tactical aerial reconnaissance , transporting airborne troops , providing fire support of their actions , electronic warfare , setting of minefield barriers and other tasks . The former Army Aviation was subsequently managed by the Chief of the Department of Army Aviation . However , by 2010 , it was announced that the 2003 decision to transfer Ground Force Aviation to the Air Force was reversed , with the transfer back to the Ground Forces to occur sometime in 2015 or 2016 . During the 2000s , the Air Forces continued to suffer from a lack of resources for pilot training . In the 1990s Russian pilots achieved approximately 10% of the flight hours of the United States Air Force . The 2007 edition of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Military Balance listed pilots of tactical aviation flying 20–25 hours a year , 61st Air Army pilots ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , 60 hours a year , and Army Aviation under VVS control 55 hours a year . In 2007 the Russian Air Force resumed the Soviet-era practice of deploying its strategic bomber aircraft on long-range patrols . This ended a 15-year unilateral suspension due to fuel costs and other economic difficulties after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Patrols towards the North Pole , the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean were reinstated , bringing the planes often close to NATO territory , including in one instance flying over the Irish Sea between the United Kingdom and Ireland . During the 2008 South Ossetian War , the Russian Air Force suffered losses of between four and seven aircraft due to Georgian anti-aircraft fire . The 2008 Russian military reforms were promptly announced following the war , which according to Western experts were intended to address many inadequacies discovered as a result . The reforms commenced during early 2009 , in which air armies were succeeded by commands , and most air regiments becoming air bases . Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology confirmed that the reorganisation would be completed by December 2009 and would see a 40 percent reduction in aircrew numbers . In February 2009 , the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that 200 of the 291 MiG-29s currently in service across all Russian air arms were unsafe and would have to be permanently grounded . This action would remove from service about a third of Russias total fighter force , some 650 aircraft . On 5 June 2009 , the Chief of the General Staff , Nikolai Makarov said of the Russian Air Force that They can run bombing missions only in daytime with the sun shining , but they miss their targets anyway . Maj . Gen . Pavel Androsov said that Russias long-range bombers would be upgraded in 2009 with the aim of being able to hit within 20 meters of their targets . Also in September 2009 it was reported that an East European network of the Joint CIS Air Defense System was to be set up by Russia and Belarus . This network was intended to protect the airspace of the two countries as defined in the supranational 1999 Union State treaty . Its planned composition was to include five Air Force units , 10 anti-aircraft units , five technical service and support units and one electronic warfare unit . It was to be placed under the command of a Russian or Belarusian Air Force or Air Defence Force senior commander . In July 2010 , Russian jet fighters made the first nonstop flights from European Russia to the Russian Far East . By August 2010 , according to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force Aleksandr Zelin , the average flight hours of a pilot in Russian tactical aviation had reached 80 hours a year , while in army aviation and military transport aviation it exceeded 100 hours a year . On 15 August 2010 , the Russian Air Force temporarily grounded its fleet of Su-25 ground attack aircraft to conduct an investigation into a crash that happened during a training mission . The Russian Defence Ministry said that the plane crashed on 6 August 2010 , 60 km to the north-west of Step air base in Siberia , according to RIA Novosti . 2011–2020 . According to the instructions of the General Staff of the Armed Forces on 1 September 2011 , the unmanned aircraft of the Russian Air Force and the personnel operating them moved under the command structure of the Russian Ground Forces . As of 2012 , the Russian Air Force operated a total of 61 air bases , including 26 air bases with tactical aircraft , of which 14 are equipped with fighter aircraft . In terms of flight hours , pilots in the Western Military District averaged 125 hours over the 2012 training year . Pilots from the Kursk air base achieved an average of 150 hours , with transport aviation averaging 170 hours . In February 2014 , during the early periods of Russias annexation of Crimea , the Russian Air Forces assets of the Southern Military District were activated and flown to the peninsula for supporting the rest of the operations . On 1 August 2015 , the Russian Air Force , along with the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces and the Air Defense Troops , were merged into a new branch of the armed forces , now officially called the Russian Aerospace Forces . On 30 September 2015 , the Russian Air Force launched a military intervention in Syria , in Syrias Homs region . On 24 November 2015 , during a bombing mission , a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 that Turkey claimed had violated its airspace . In March 2020 , the indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets by the Russian Air Force in Syria has been described as amounting to war crime by UN HRC report . On 9 November 2020 , a Russian Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter was shot down mistakenly by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war killing 2 crew members and injuring 1 more . Days later , after the signing of the ceasefire agreement , Russian peacekeepers were deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh with aviation for patrolling its borders . 2021–present . Modernisation plans and programs carried out since the 2010s are being continued into 2021 as a part of Russias State Armament Program for 2018–2027 . Leadership . Previously the highest military office until 1 August 2015 . Since the merger between the Russian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces on 1 August 2015 , the commander of the Russian Air Force as part of the new Russian Aerospace Forces is titled Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces and Commander of the Russian Air Force . Lieutenant General Andrey Yudin became the first holder of the position until he was succeeded by Lieutenant General Sergey Dronov in August 2019 . Structure . In 2009 the structure of the Russian Air Force was completely changed to a command-air base structure from the previous structure of air army-air division or corps-air regiment . The VVS is now divided to 4 operational commands , the Aerospace Defense Operational Strategic Command ( seemingly primarily made up of the former Special Purpose Command ) , the Military Transport Aviation Command , and the Long-Range Aviation Command . This listing is a composite ; the available new information covers frontline forces , and the forces of central subordination are as of approximately August 2008 . Warfare.ru maintains what appears to be a reasonably up to date listing , and Combat Aircraft magazine in June 2010 listed their organisations estimate of the new order of battle . This listing appears to be as of June 2009 : Regional air armies . - 1st Aerospace Defence Forces Army ( Moscow ) - 4th Aerospace Defense brigade ( Dolgoprudnyi , Moscow Oblast ) - 5th Aerospace Defense brigade ( Petrovskoe , Moscow Oblast ) - 6th Aerospace Defense brigade ( Rzhev , Tver Oblast ) ( former 32nd Corps of PVO? ) - 6963rd aviation base ( Kursk Vostochny Airport ) ( MiG-29SMT/UBT ) - 6968th fighter aviation base ( Borisovsky Khotilovo , Tver Oblast ) ( Su-27 , MiG-31B , MiG-31BM ) - 6th Air and Air Defence Forces Army ( Voronezh ) ( Western Military District ) - 1st Aerospace Defense brigade ( Severomorsk ) - 2nd Aerospace Defense brigade ( St .

The precise quantitative and qualitative composition of the Russian Air Force is unknown and figures include both serviceable and unserviceable aircraft as well as those placed into storage or sitting in reserve . FlightGlobal estimated that there were about 3,947 aircraft in inventory in 2015 . According to the Russian Defense Ministry , the share of modern armament in the Air Force had reached about 35% during 2014 . The figure was raised to 66% by late 2016 and to 72% by late 2017 . Estimates provided by the IISS show that Russian Air Force combat pilots average 60 to 100 flight hours per year and pilots flying transport aircraft average 120 flight hours per year . Squadrons . As of 2014 : - 8 × Bomber squadrons ( 4 operating Tu-22M3/MR ; 3 operating Tu-95MS ; 1 operating Tu-160 ) - 37 × Fighter squadrons ( 8 operating MiG-29 ; 3 operating MiG-29SMT ; 11 operating the MiG-31/MiG-31BM ; 10 operating Su-27 ; 4 operating Su-27SM1/Su-30M2 ; 1 operating Su-27SM3/Su-30M2 ) - 27 × Attack squadrons ( 11 operating the Su-24M/Su-24M2 ; 13 operating Su-25/Su-25SM ; 3 operating Su-34 ) - 10 × Attack &amp; Reconnaissance squadrons ( 1 operating Su-24M/MR ; 8 operating Su-24MR ; 1 operating Mig-25RB ) - 1 × AEW&amp;C squadron ( 1 operating A-50/A50-U ) - 1 × Tanker squadron ( 1 operating Il-78/Il-78M ) Ranks and insignia . The Russian Air Force inherited the ranks of the Soviet Union , although the insignia and uniform were slightly altered and the old Tsarist crown and double-headed eagle were re-introduced . The Russian Air Force uses the same rank structure as the Russian Ground Forces . Aircraft procurement .

In the 1990s Russian pilots achieved approximately 10% of the flight hours of the United States Air Force . The 2007 edition of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Military Balance listed pilots of tactical aviation flying 20–25 hours a year , 61st Air Army pilots ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , 60 hours a year , and Army Aviation under VVS control 55 hours a year .

The modern Russian Air Force was originally established on 7 May 1992 following Boris Yeltsins creation of the Ministry of Defence ; however , the Russian Federations air force can trace its lineage and traditions back to the Imperial Russian Air Service ( 1912–1917 ) and the Soviet Air Forces ( 1918–1991 ) . The Russian Navy has its own independent air arm , the Russian Naval Aviation , which is the former Soviet Aviatsiya Voyenno-morskogo Flota ( lit . Aviation of the military-sea fleet ) , or AVMF . History . 1991–2000 . Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union into its fifteen constituent republics in December 1991 , the aircraft and personnel of the Soviet Air Forces—the VVS were divided among the newly independent states . General Pyotr Deynekin , the former deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet Air Forces , became the first commander of the new organisation on 24 August 1991 . Russia received the majority of the most modern fighters and 65% of the manpower . The major commands of the former Soviet VVS—the Long-Range Aviation , Military Transport Aviation and Frontal Aviation were renamed , with few changes , Russian VVS commands . However , many regiments , aircraft , and personnel were claimed by the republics they were based in , forming the core of the new republics air forces . Some aircraft in Belarus and Ukraine ( such as Tupolev Tu-160s ) were returned to Russia , sometimes in return for debt reductions , as well as a long-range aviation division based at Dolon in Kazakhstan . During the 1990s , the financial stringency was felt throughout the armed forces made its mark on the Russian Air Forces as well . Pilots and other personnel could sometimes not get their wages for months , and on occasion resorted to desperate measures : four MiG-31 pilots at Yelizovo in the Far East went on hunger strike in 1996 to demand back pay which was several months overdue , and the problem was only resolved by diverting unit money intended for other tasks . As a result of the cutbacks , infrastructure became degraded as well , and in 1998 , 40% of military airfields needed repair . The VVS participated in the First Chechen War ( 1994–1996 ) and the Second Chechen War ( 1999–2002 ) . These campaigns also presented significant difficulties for the VVS including the terrain , lack of significant fixed targets and insurgents armed with Stinger and Strela-2M surface-to-air missiles . The former Soviet Air Defence Forces remained independent for several years under Russian control , only merging with the Air Forces in 1998 . The decree merging the two forces was issued by President Boris Yeltsin on 16 July 1997 . During 1998 altogether 580 units and formations were disbanded , 134 reorganised , and over 600 given a new jurisdiction . The redistribution of forces affected 95% of aircraft , 98% of helicopters , 93% of anti-aircraft missile complexes , 95% of the equipment of radiotechnical troops , 100% of anti-aircraft missiles and over 60% of aviation armament . More than 600,000 tons of material changed location and 3,500 aircraft changed airfields . Military Transport Aviation planes took more than 40,000 families to new residence areas . The short-lived operational commands were abolished . Two air armies , the 37th Air Army ( long-range aviation ) and the 61st Air Army ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , were established directly under the Supreme Command . The former frontal aviation and anti-aircraft forces were organised as Air Force Armies and Anti-Aircraft Defense Armies under the military district commanders . There were initially four such armies with headquarters in St.Petersburg ( Leningrad Military District ) , Rostov-on-Don ( North Caucasus Military District ) , Khabarovsk ( Far East Military District ) , and Chita ( Siberian Military District ) . Two military districts had separate Air and Air Defence Corps . When the Transbaikal Military District and Siberian Military District were merged , the 14th Air Army was reactivated to serve as the air force formation in the area . The number of servicemen in the air force was reduced to about 185,000 from the former combined number of 318,000 . 123,500 positions were abolished , including almost 1,000 colonel positions . The resignation of 3000 other servicemen included 46 generals of which 15 were colonel generals . On 29 December 1998 Colonel General Anatoly Kornukov , a former Air Defence Forces officer and new commander-in-chief of the merged force , succeeding Deynekin , reported to the Russian defence minister that the task had in principle been achieved . General Kornukov established the new headquarters of the force in Zarya , near Balashikha , 20 km east of the centre of Moscow , in the former PVO central command post , where the CIS common air defence system is directed from . 2001–2010 . In 1999 Vladimir Putin became Prime Minister of Russia and then President in 2000 ; he continued to hold one or the other of these offices through every year since . In December 2003 the aviation assets of the Russian Ground Forces—mostly helicopters—were transferred to the VVS , following the shooting down of a Mi-26 helicopter in Chechnya on 19 August 2002 , that claimed 19 lives . The former Army Aviation was in its previous form intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces , by providing their tactical air support , conducting tactical aerial reconnaissance , transporting airborne troops , providing fire support of their actions , electronic warfare , setting of minefield barriers and other tasks . The former Army Aviation was subsequently managed by the Chief of the Department of Army Aviation . However , by 2010 , it was announced that the 2003 decision to transfer Ground Force Aviation to the Air Force was reversed , with the transfer back to the Ground Forces to occur sometime in 2015 or 2016 . During the 2000s , the Air Forces continued to suffer from a lack of resources for pilot training . In the 1990s Russian pilots achieved approximately 10% of the flight hours of the United States Air Force . The 2007 edition of the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) Military Balance listed pilots of tactical aviation flying 20–25 hours a year , 61st Air Army pilots ( former Military Transport Aviation ) , 60 hours a year , and Army Aviation under VVS control 55 hours a year . In 2007 the Russian Air Force resumed the Soviet-era practice of deploying its strategic bomber aircraft on long-range patrols . This ended a 15-year unilateral suspension due to fuel costs and other economic difficulties after the collapse of the Soviet Union . Patrols towards the North Pole , the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean were reinstated , bringing the planes often close to NATO territory , including in one instance flying over the Irish Sea between the United Kingdom and Ireland . During the 2008 South Ossetian War , the Russian Air Force suffered losses of between four and seven aircraft due to Georgian anti-aircraft fire . The 2008 Russian military reforms were promptly announced following the war , which according to Western experts were intended to address many inadequacies discovered as a result . The reforms commenced during early 2009 , in which air armies were succeeded by commands , and most air regiments becoming air bases . Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology confirmed that the reorganisation would be completed by December 2009 and would see a 40 percent reduction in aircrew numbers . In February 2009 , the Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that 200 of the 291 MiG-29s currently in service across all Russian air arms were unsafe and would have to be permanently grounded . This action would remove from service about a third of Russias total fighter force , some 650 aircraft . On 5 June 2009 , the Chief of the General Staff , Nikolai Makarov said of the Russian Air Force that They can run bombing missions only in daytime with the sun shining , but they miss their targets anyway . Maj . Gen . Pavel Androsov said that Russias long-range bombers would be upgraded in 2009 with the aim of being able to hit within 20 meters of their targets . Also in September 2009 it was reported that an East European network of the Joint CIS Air Defense System was to be set up by Russia and Belarus . This network was intended to protect the airspace of the two countries as defined in the supranational 1999 Union State treaty . Its planned composition was to include five Air Force units , 10 anti-aircraft units , five technical service and support units and one electronic warfare unit . It was to be placed under the command of a Russian or Belarusian Air Force or Air Defence Force senior commander . In July 2010 , Russian jet fighters made the first nonstop flights from European Russia to the Russian Far East . By August 2010 , according to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Air Force Aleksandr Zelin , the average flight hours of a pilot in Russian tactical aviation had reached 80 hours a year , while in army aviation and military transport aviation it exceeded 100 hours a year . On 15 August 2010 , the Russian Air Force temporarily grounded its fleet of Su-25 ground attack aircraft to conduct an investigation into a crash that happened during a training mission . The Russian Defence Ministry said that the plane crashed on 6 August 2010 , 60 km to the north-west of Step air base in Siberia , according to RIA Novosti . 2011–2020 . According to the instructions of the General Staff of the Armed Forces on 1 September 2011 , the unmanned aircraft of the Russian Air Force and the personnel operating them moved under the command structure of the Russian Ground Forces . As of 2012 , the Russian Air Force operated a total of 61 air bases , including 26 air bases with tactical aircraft , of which 14 are equipped with fighter aircraft . In terms of flight hours , pilots in the Western Military District averaged 125 hours over the 2012 training year . Pilots from the Kursk air base achieved an average of 150 hours , with transport aviation averaging 170 hours . In February 2014 , during the early periods of Russias annexation of Crimea , the Russian Air Forces assets of the Southern Military District were activated and flown to the peninsula for supporting the rest of the operations . On 1 August 2015 , the Russian Air Force , along with the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces and the Air Defense Troops , were merged into a new branch of the armed forces , now officially called the Russian Aerospace Forces . On 30 September 2015 , the Russian Air Force launched a military intervention in Syria , in Syrias Homs region . On 24 November 2015 , during a bombing mission , a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 that Turkey claimed had violated its airspace . In March 2020 , the indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets by the Russian Air Force in Syria has been described as amounting to war crime by UN HRC report . On 9 November 2020 , a Russian Mil Mi-24 attack helicopter was shot down mistakenly by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war killing 2 crew members and injuring 1 more . Days later , after the signing of the ceasefire agreement , Russian peacekeepers were deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh with aviation for patrolling its borders . 2021–present . Modernisation plans and programs carried out since the 2010s are being continued into 2021 as a part of Russias State Armament Program for 2018–2027 . Leadership . Previously the highest military office until 1 August 2015 . Since the merger between the Russian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces on 1 August 2015 , the commander of the Russian Air Force as part of the new Russian Aerospace Forces is titled Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces and Commander of the Russian Air Force . Lieutenant General Andrey Yudin became the first holder of the position until he was succeeded by Lieutenant General Sergey Dronov in August 2019 . Structure . In 2009 the structure of the Russian Air Force was completely changed to a command-air base structure from the previous structure of air army-air division or corps-air regiment . The VVS is now divided to 4 operational commands , the Aerospace Defense Operational Strategic Command ( seemingly primarily made up of the former Special Purpose Command ) , the Military Transport Aviation Command , and the Long-Range Aviation Command . This listing is a composite ; the available new information covers frontline forces , and the forces of central subordination are as of approximately August 2008 .

The modern Russian Air Force was originally established on 7 May 1992 following Boris Yeltsins creation of the Ministry of Defence ; however , the Russian Federations air force can trace its lineage and traditions back to the Imperial Russian Air Service ( 1912–1917 ) and the Soviet Air Forces ( 1918–1991 ) . In December 2003 the aviation assets of the Russian Ground Forces—mostly helicopters—were transferred to the VVS , following the shooting down of a Mi-26 helicopter in Chechnya on 19 August 2002 , that claimed 19 lives . The former Army Aviation was in its previous form intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces , by providing their tactical air support , conducting tactical aerial reconnaissance , transporting airborne troops , providing fire support of their actions , electronic warfare , setting of minefield barriers and other tasks . The former Army Aviation was subsequently managed by the Chief of the Department of Army Aviation . However , by 2010 , it was announced that the 2003 decision to transfer Ground Force Aviation to the Air Force was reversed , with the transfer back to the Ground Forces to occur sometime in 2015 or 2016 . On 1 August 2015 , the Russian Air Force , along with the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces and the Air Defense Troops , were merged into a new branch of the armed forces , now officially called the Russian Aerospace Forces . On 30 September 2015 , the Russian Air Force launched a military intervention in Syria , in Syrias Homs region . On 24 November 2015 , during a bombing mission , a Turkish Air Force F-16 shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 that Turkey claimed had violated its airspace . Previously the highest military office until 1 August 2015 . Since the merger between the Russian Air Force and the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces on 1 August 2015 , the commander of the Russian Air Force as part of the new Russian Aerospace Forces is titled Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Aerospace Forces and Commander of the Russian Air Force .

Stanton Jefferies Leonard Stanton Jefferies LRAM ( 4 September 1896 – 22 October 1961 ) was an British musician , composer , and conductor . He was the first director of music at the British Broadcasting Company , and pioneered techniques for broadcasting live music . Early life . Jefferies was born at Weston-super-Mare on 4 September 1896 , and studied organ and piano at the Royal College of Music . His studies were interrupted by World War I , when he served as a naval telegraphist . From 1919 to 1921 , he was organist and music director at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great , in the City of London . Career . While employed by Marconi , he was appointed , in around June 1922 , to Marconis experimental station 2LO , the British Broadcasting Companys forerunner , to be responsible for concerts broadcast from Marconi House , under the management of Arthur Burrows . By the end of that year , 2LO had been absorbed into the nascent British Broadcasting Company . He was its first director of music . He continued to work for the BBC after it became the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927 . While at the BBC , Jefferies made broadcasts in which he gave organ recitals and conducted orchestral performances . He composed music for Childrens Hour programmes , on which he played the character of Uncle Jeff , and undertook the role of what would now be called a continuity announcer . Another of his duties was to build a collection of music recordings , which became the BBC Music Library . He was responsible for the appointment , in 1923 , of Cecil Dixon as the BBCs first accompanist , the two having become acquainted at the Royal College of Music . Famously , the director of the BBC , John Reith , was once entertaining the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Randall Davidson , who expressed a love of piano music . Reith telephoned the BBCs headquarters , and within minutes , Jefferies was playing Schuberts Marche Militaire , live on air . In 1924 , he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a series of concerts at the Central Hall , Westminster . However , in 1926 , having realised that his opportunities to progress as a musician and conductor were limited , he moved to a more technical role , responsible for the quality of broadcasts . Jefferies left the BBC in June 1935 , after further career disappointments , despite support from Adrian Boult . Following military service in World War II ( he received an emergency commission as a lieutenant on 20 November 1940 ) , he returned to the BBC as a producer , continuing in the latter role until at least 1956 . He retired formally from the BBC that year , though he continued to undertake some work for them until the next year . In October 1935 , shortly after leaving the BBC with much regret , he published a three-part reminiscence of his radio work , Soap Box Days , in the magazine Popular Wireless .

In the 1950s , she was one of the founders of stellar nucleosynthesis and was first author of the influential BFH paper . During the 1960s and 70s she worked on galaxy rotation curves and quasars , discovering the most distant astronomical object then known . In the 1980s and 90s she helped develop and utilise the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope . Burbidge was well known for her work opposing discrimination against women in astronomy . Burbidge held several leadership and administrative posts , including Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory ( 1973–75 ) , President of the American Astronomical Society ( 1976–78 ) , and President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( 1983 ) . Burbidge worked at the University of London Observatory , Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago , the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge , the California Institute of Technology , and the University of California San Diego ( UCSD ) . From 1979 to 1988 she was the first director of the Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences at UCSD , where she worked from 1962 until her retirement . Research career . Burbidge studied at University College London ( UCL ) , where she received an undergraduate degree in 1939 and a PhD in 1943 . During World War II , she acted as a caretaker at University of London Observatory ( ULO ) ; the wartime blackout made it easier for her to use the observatorys telescopes . In August 1944 , her observations at ULO were twice interrupted by V-1 flying bomb explosions nearby . She was turned down for a postdoctoral fellowship from Carnegie Observatories in 1945 because the job required observing at Mount Wilson Observatory , which was reserved for men only at that time . Shortly after the war , she taught astronomy at ULO to undergraduate students from across the University of London system , including Arthur C . Clarke who was then an undergraduate at Kings College London . In 1951 she took a position at the University of Chicagos Yerkes Observatory , Wisconsin , her first job in the United States . Her research during this period focused on the abundances of chemical elements in stars . She returned to the UK in 1953 , when Margaret and her husband Geoffrey Burbidge were invited to work with William Alfred Fowler and Fred Hoyle at the University of Cambridge . The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyles hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions , and Fowlers laboratory experiments on those reactions . The idea became known as stellar nucleosynthesis . They published their model in a series of papers , culminating in a magnum opus in 1957 , now known as the BFH paper after the initials of Burbidge , Burbidge , Fowler &amp; Hoyle . Margaret Burbidge was the first author of the paper , which was written while she was pregnant . The paper demonstrated that most heavier chemical elements were formed in stellar evolution . The theory they developed remains the fundamental basis for stellar nucleosynthesis . Fowler was later awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics ( shared with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar ) for his work on nucleosynthesis , and expressed surprise that Burbidge was not included . When Fowler moved back to the US , he advised the Burbidges to come with him to California , suggesting Margaret ( the observer ) should re-apply for the fellowship at Mount Wilson Observatory while Geoff ( the theorist ) should seek the Kellogg Fellowship at Caltech . Margarets application was again refused on gender grounds , so the couple swapped applications . Geoff won the position at Mount Wilson , while Margaret took the Caltech job in 1955 . Whenever Geoff was required to go observing on Mount Wilson , Margaret would accompany him , ostensibly as his assistant . In reality , Geoff worked in the photographic dark room while Margaret operated the telescope . When the observatorys management found out , they eventually agreed that she could observe there , but only if she and her husband stayed in a separate self-catered cottage on the grounds , rather than the catered dormitory which had been designed for men only . She joined the University of California San Diego ( UCSD ) in 1962 . In the 1960s and 1970s she measured the masses , compositions , and rotation curves of galaxies and performed early spectroscopic studies of quasars . Her discoveries in this area included QSO B1442+101 at a redshift of 3.5 , making it the most distant known object at the time , a record which she held from 1974–82 . She was a supporter of the steady state theory of cosmology , but her own work on quasars helped to support the alternative Big Bang theory . In 1972 Burbidge became director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory ( RGO ) , on secondment from UCSD . For 300 years the post had always been held by the Astronomer Royal , but when Burbidge was appointed to the RGO directorship the posts were split , with radio astronomer Martin Ryle appointed as Astronomer Royal . Burbidge sometimes attributed this to sexism , and at other times to politics intended to reduce the clout of the RGO director . Burbidge left the RGO in 1974 , fifteen months after joining , due to controversy over moving the Isaac Newton Telescope from RGO headquarters at Herstmonceux Castle to Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands . Burbidge campaigned in opposition to discrimination against women in astronomy and was also opposed to positive discrimination . In 1972 she turned down the Annie J . Cannon Award of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) because it was awarded to women only : It is high time that discrimination in favor of , as well as against , women in professional life be removed . Her letter declining the prize caused the AAS to set up its first committee on the status of women in astronomy . In 1976 , she became the first female president of the AAS . During her term as president she convinced the members to ban AAS meetings in states which had not ratified the Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution . In 1984 the AAS awarded her its highest honor , regardless of gender , the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship . From 1979 to 1988 , she served as the first director of the UCSDs Center for Astrophysics and Space Science . In 1981 she was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , serving her one-year term from February 1982 to February 1983 . At UCSD she helped develop the Faint Object Spectrograph for the Hubble Space Telescope , which launched in 1990 . With this instrument , she and her team discovered that the galaxy Messier 82 contains a supermassive black hole at its center . As professor emerita at UCSD she continued to be active in research until the early 21st century . Burbidge authored over 370 research papers . Personal life . Eleanor Margaret Peachey was born in Davenport , Stockport , UK , nine months after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War . She was the daughter of Marjorie Stott Peachey and Stanley John Peachey . She first became interested in astronomy aged 3 or 4 , after seeing the stars on a ferry trip across the English Channel . By age 12 , she was reading astronomy textbooks by James Jeans , a distant relative of her mother . On 2 April 1948 , Margaret Peachey married Geoffrey Burbidge . The couple had met six months earlier at University College London . Geoffrey was a theoretical physicist , but Margarets passion for astronomy convinced him to switch to theoretical astrophysics . The two collaborated on much of their subsequent research . The couple had a daughter , Sarah , who was born in late 1956 . In 1977 , Margaret became a United States citizen . Geoffrey Burbidge died in 2010 . Margaret Burbidge died on 5 April 2020 , in San Francisco at the age of 100 after suffering a fall . Honors . Awards . - Helen B .

He is best known today for Chinese Restaurant ( 1915 ) , in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art , the finest canvas of his Cubist phase , in the words of art historian Avis Berman . Biography . Early years . Born in the Polish city of Białystok , then part of the Russian Empire , Weber emigrated to the United States and settled in Brooklyn with his Orthodox Jewish parents at the age of ten . He studied art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn under Arthur Wesley Dow . Dow was a fortunate early influence on Weber as he was an enlightened and vital teacher in a time of conservative art instruction , a man who was interested in new approaches to creating art . Dow had met Paul Gauguin in Pont-Aven , was a devoted student of Japanese art , and defended the advanced modernist painting and sculpture he saw at the Armory Show in New York in 1913 . In 1905 , after teaching in Virginia and Minnesota , Weber had saved enough money to travel to Europe , where he studied at the Académie Julian in Paris and acquainted himself with the work of such modernists as Henri Rousseau ( who became a good friend ) , Henri Matisse , Pablo Picasso , and other members of the School of Paris . His friends among fellow Americans included some equally adventurous young painters , such as Abraham Walkowitz , H . Lyman Sayen , and Patrick Henry Bruce . Avant-garde France in the years immediately before World War I was fertile and welcoming territory for Weber , then in his early twenties . He arrived in Paris in time to see a major Cézanne exhibition , meet the poet Guillaume Apollinaire , frequent Gertrude Steins salon , and enroll in classes in Matisses private Academie . Rousseau gave him some of his works ; others , Weber purchased . He was responsible for Rousseaus first exhibition in the United States . America . In 1909 he returned to New York and helped to introduce Cubism to America . He is now considered one of the most significant early American Cubists , but the reception his work received in New York at the time was profoundly discouraging . Critical response to his paintings in a 1911 show at the 291 gallery , run by Alfred Stieglitz , was an occasion for one of the most merciless critical whippings that any artist has received in America . The reviews were of an almost hysterical violence . He was attacked for his brutal , vulgar , and unnecessary art license . Even a critic who usually tried to be sympathetic to new art , James Gibbons Huneker , protested that the artists clever technique had left viewers with no real picture and made use of the adage , The operation was successful , but the patient died . As art historian Sam Hunter wrote , Webers wistful , tentative Cubism provided the philistine press with their first solid target prior to the Armory Show . Weber was sustained by the respect of some eminent peers , such as photographers Alvin Langdon Coburn and Clarence White , and museum director John Cotton Dana , who saw to it that Weber was the subject of a one-man exhibition at the Newark Museum in 1913 , the first modernist exhibition in an American museum . For a few years , Weber enjoyed a productive if rocky relationship with Stieglitz , and he published two essays in Stieglitzs journal Camera Work . ( He also wrote Cubist poems and published a book , Essays on Art , in 1916. ) So poor was Weber in these years that he camped out for some weeks in Stieglitzs gallery . Weber was also closely acquainted with Wilhelmina Weber Furlong and Thomas Furlong , whom he met at the Art Students League , where he taught from 1919 to 1921 and 1926 to 1927 . Weber died in Great Neck , New York in 1961 . He was the subject of a major retrospective at the Jewish Museum in 1982 . Weber evidently was a prickly personality even with his allies . He and Stieglitz had a falling-out , and Weber was not represented in the famous Armory Show because his friend , Arthur B . Davies , one of the shows organizers , had only allotted him space for two paintings . In a fit of pique at Davies , he withdrew entirely from the exhibition . Other artists in the Stieglitz circle kept their distance , especially after Weber told people that there were only three indisputably great modern painters : Cézanne , Rousseau , and himself . Almost without exception , they found him obnoxious : opinionated , rude , intolerant . Success . In time , Webers work found more adherents , including Alfred H . Barr , Jr. , the first director of the Museum of Modern Art . In 1930 , the Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective of his work , the first solo exhibition at that museum of an American artist . He was praised as a pioneer of modern art in America in a 1945 Life magazine article . In 1948 , Look magazine reported on a survey among art experts to determine the greatest living American artists ; Weber was rated second , behind only John Marin . He was the subject of a major traveling retrospective in 1949 . He became more popular in the 1940s and 1950s for his figurative work , often expressionist renderings of Jewish families , rabbis , and Talmudic scholars , than for the early modernist work he had abandoned circa 1920 and on which his current reputation is founded . Not everyone believed that Weber fulfilled his early potential as he became a more representational and expressionist painter post-World War I . Critic Hilton Kramer wrote of him that , in light of the remarkable beginning of his career , Weber proved instead to be one of the great disappointments of twentieth-century American art . Others however , because of his bold Cubist decade , hold him in the same high regard as other native modernists like John Marin , Arthur Dove , Marsden Hartley , and Charles Demuth . Poetry . While lecturing at the Clarence H . White School for Photography , Weber wrote his Cubist Poems that were to be published in 1914 . In 1926 , the artist released another collection entitled Primitives : Poems and Woodcuts . Weber designed the modernist-style binding for the book , as well as providing eleven woodcuts for the illustrations . First published by Spiral Press in a run of 350 copies , original editions are now rare . &lt;poem&gt;:Cubes , cubes , cubes , cubes , Collections .

His works include Fugue for a Darkening Island , The Inverted World , The Affirmation , The Glamour , The Prestige , and The Separation . Priest has been strongly influenced by the science fiction of H . G . Wells and in 2006 was appointed Vice-President of the international H . G . Wells Society . Early life . Priest was born in Cheadle , Cheshire , England in 1943 . As a child , Priest spent some time holidaying in the English county of Dorset . Here he explored the ancient hillfort of Maiden Castle , near Dorchester , which he would later use as the location for the novel A Dream of Wessex . Career . Priests first story , The Run , was published in 1966 . Formerly an accountant and audit clerk , he became a full-time writer in 1968 . One of his early novels , The Affirmation , concerns a traumatized man who apparently flips into a delusional world in which he experiences a lengthy voyage to an archipelago of exotic islands . This setting featured in many of Priests short stories , which raises the question of whether the Dream Archipelago is actually a fantasy . The state of mind depicted in this novel is similar to that of the delusional fantasy-prone psychoanalytic patient ( Kirk Allen ) in Robert Lindners The Fifty-Minute Hour , or Jack Londons tortured prisoner in The Star Rover . Priest also dealt with delusional alternate realities in A Dream of Wessex , in which a group of experimenters for a British government project are brain-wired to a hypnosis machine and jointly participate in an imaginary but as-real-as-real future in a vacation island off the coast of a Sovietized Britain . His most recent novels are The Islanders ( 2011 ) , set in the Dream Archipelago , and The Adjacent ( 2013 ) , a multi-strand narrative with recurring characters . Of his narratives plot twists , Priest told an interviewer in 1995 , my shocks are based on a sudden devastating reversal of what the reader knows or believes . Tie-in work . Priest wrote the tie-in novel to accompany the 1999 David Cronenberg movie eXistenZ , which contains themes of the novels A Dream of Wessex and The Extremes . Such themes include the question of the extent to which we can trust what we believe to be reality and our memories . Priest was approached to write stories for the 18th and 19th seasons of Doctor Who . The first , Sealed Orders , was a political thriller based on Gallifrey commissioned by script editor Douglas Adams ; it was eventually abandoned due to script problems and replaced with Warriors Gate . The second , The Enemy Within , was also eventually abandoned due to script problems and what Priest perceived as insulting treatment after he was asked to modify the script to include the death of Adric . It was replaced by Earthshock . Priest received payment while Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Eric Saward were forced to pen a letter of apology for the treatment of the writer . This falling-out soured the attitude of the production office to the use of established literary authors , and no more were commissioned until Neil Gaiman authored the episode The Doctors Wife in 2011 . A film of his novel The Prestige was released on 20 October 2006 . It was directed by Christopher Nolan and starred Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman . Despite differences between the novel and screenplay , Nolan was reportedly so concerned the denouement be kept a surprise that he blocked plans for a lucrative US tie-in edition of the book . Pseudonyms . - Priest uses the pseudonyms John Luther Novak and Colin Wedgelock , usually for movie novelizations . As well as the eXistenZ novelization ( which undermined the pseudonym by including Priests biography on the pre-title page ) , he has novelised the movies Mona Lisa ( as John Luther Novak ) and Short Circuit ( as Colin Wedgelock ) . - Priest has co-operated with fellow British science fiction author David Langford on various enterprises under the Ansible brand . Other writing . Priest has written for The Guardian since 2002 , largely obituaries of such figures as Robert Sheckley , Stanislaw Lem , Jack Williamson , Diana Wynne Jones , John Christopher and many more . Awards and honours . Priest has won the BSFA award for the best novel four times : in 1974 for Inverted World ; in 1998 for The Extremes ; in 2002 for The Separation and in 2011 for The Islanders . He has won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction and the World Fantasy Award ( for The Prestige ) . He won the BSFA award for short fiction in 1979 for the short story Palely Loitering ; and has been nominated for Hugo Awards in the categories of Best Novel , Best Novella , Best Novelette , and Best Non-Fiction Book ( this last for The Book on the Edge of Forever ( also known as Last Deadloss Visions ) , an exploration of the unpublished Last Dangerous Visions anthology ) . The Space Machine won the International SF prize in the 1977 Ditmar Awards . Priests 1979 essay The Making of the Lesbian Horse ( published as a Novacon chapbook ) takes a humorous look at the roots of his acclaimed novel Inverted World . He was guest of honour at Novacon 9 in 1979 and Novacon 30 in 2000 , and at the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention in 2005 . In 1983 Priest was named one of the 20 Granta Best of Young British Novelists . In 1988 he won the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis for The Glamour as Best Foreign Fiction Book . Between 7 November and 7 December 2007 , the Chelsea College of Art and Design had an exhibition in its gallery Chelsea Space inspired by Priests novel The Affirmation . It followed themes of personal history and memory ( which ) through the lens of a more antagonistic and critical form of interpretation , aims to point towards an overtly positive viewpoint on contemporary art practice over any traditional melancholy fixation . Personal life . Priest lived in Devon but now lives on Isle of Bute . He was married to writer Lisa Tuttle from 1981 to 1987 and to Leigh Kennedy from 1988 to 2011 , with whom he had twins . He currently lives with speculative fiction writer Nina Allan . Bibliography . Novels . - Indoctrinaire . London : Faber and Faber , 1970 . - Fugue for a Darkening Island .

He played his entire career for both Leeds United and Arsenal , making 668 league appearances and played at the highest level of English football in four decades . He was capped by both the England U21 and England B sides . Club career . Lukic signed for Leeds United as a schoolboy . He made his debut for the Elland Road side in 1979 and went on to play 165 games for them . After making a transfer request , Lukic moved to Arsenal in July 1983 for £75,000 , as a long-term replacement for Pat Jennings . By the middle of the 1984–85 season he was the clubs No . 1 , and won the League Cup in 1987 and the Division One title in 1989 . He was ever present in Arsenals first team throughout seasons 1987–88 , 1988–89 and 1989–90 . Lukic played in the final game of the 1989 season , where Arsenal won the title in the last minute of the game against Liverpool , with Lukic starting the move which led to Michael Thomass famous goal . In the summer of 1990 Arsenal manager George Graham signed David Seaman from Queens Park Rangers – Seaman had been Lukics understudy at Leeds . This outraged many Arsenal fans at the time , especially as Lukic was a fan favourite . On his departure , Graham commented I still think John Lukic is one of the best keepers in the country ; I just think David Seaman is the best . Having played 277 times for the Gunners , Lukic rejoined Leeds for £1million , playing a further 265 times and winning a second League title in 1991–92 and a runners up medal in the League Cup in 1995–96 . Lukic was displaced at Leeds by the signing of Nigel Martyn , and in 1996 he returned for a second spell at Arsenal . As deputy to David Seaman , he played 15 league games in 1996–97 as cover , but after the signing of Alex Manninger in 1997 he stepped down to No . 3 . However , with Manninger injured , Lukic was on the bench for Arsenals 2000 UEFA Cup Final loss to Galatasaray , earning him a runners-up medal . In 2000 , after a series of injuries to the clubs other keepers , he made a brief return to the first team , playing four times . The last of these four games , against Derby County , was a month shy of his 40th birthday ; another one of these , a match against Lazio on 17 October 2000 made him , at the time , the oldest player ever to take part in a UEFA Champions League match . This has since been surpassed by Dany Verlinden , Alessandro Costacurta and Marco Ballotta . He retired in 2001 and now coaches part-time . He has won the league with two clubs , a feat he shares with fellow professionals such as Nicolas Anelka , Eric Cantona , Carlos Tevez , Ashley Cole , and Kevin Richardson . He is one of possibly four players to have played in the top flight of English football in four decades , the other players to attain this achievement are Peter Shilton , Steve Ogrizovic and Stanley Matthews . International career . Though Lukic played for England at youth and under-21 level , he never won a cap for the senior team . He was once considered for selection to the Yugoslav national side ( due to his Yugoslavian parentage ) in the late eighties but he declined the offer . Personal life . Lukic was born in Chesterfield to Yugoslavian parents ; an urban legend states that Lukics mother survived the Munich air disaster while pregnant with him ; this is untrue , as the crash happened in February 1958 , more than two years before Lukic was born . There was a Mrs Lukić on board the plane , who did survive ( along with her young daughter ) after being saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg . Lukic has a son , also called John and also a goalkeeper , who was a youth player on the books of Nottingham Forest until 2005 when he was snubbed a professional contract ; however , he signed professional terms with Grimsby Town in June 2005 to act as understudy to Steve Mildenhall for the 2005–06 season . However , he was released at the end of the season and briefly signed for Barnsley before disappearing from competitive football . Lukic now works as a freelance goalkeeping coach and tours the country as an after-dinner speaker .

It was designed by Henry Robertson and built from 1838 to 1840 by James Atkinson . It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 . Since 1975 , the site has been leased to the Council of the City of Blacktown . History . Aboriginal and European settler history . The area of Prospect Reservoir is an area of known Aboriginal occupation , with favourable camping locations along the Eastern Creek and Prospect Creek catchments , and in elevated landscapes to the south . There is also evidence to suggest that the occupation of these lands continued after European contact , through discovery of intermingled glass and stone flakes in archaeological surveys of the place . The area was settled by Europeans by 1789 . Prospect Hill , Sydneys largest body of igneous rock , lies centrally in the Cumberland Plain and dominates the landscape of the area . Very early after first settlement , on 26 April 1788 , an exploration party heading west led by Governor Phillip , climbed Prospect Hill . An account by Phillip states that the exploration party saw from Prospect Hill , for the first time since we landed Carmathen Hills ( Blue Mountains ) as likewise the hills to the southward . Phillips Bellevue ( Prospect Hill ) acquired considerable significance for the new settlers . Prospect Hill provided a point from which distances could be meaningfully calculated , and became a major reference point for other early explorers . When Watkin Tench made another official journey to the west in 1789 , he began his journey with reference to Prospect Hill , which commanded a view of the great chain of mountains to the west . A runaway convict , George Bruce , used Prospect Hill as a hideaway from soldiers in the mid-1790s . During the initial struggling years of European settlement in NSW , Governor Phillip began to settle time-expired convicts on the land as farmers , after the success of James Ruse at Rose Hill . On 18 July 1791 Phillip placed a number of men on the eastern and southern slopes of Prospect Hill , as the soils weathered from the basalt cap were richer than the sandstone derived soils of the Cumberland Plain . The grants , mostly 30 acres , encircled Prospect Hill . The settlers included William Butler , James Castle , Samuel Griffiths , John Herbert , George Lisk , Joseph Morley , John Nicols , William Parish and Edward Pugh . The arrival of the first settlers prompted the first organised Aboriginal resistance to the spread of settlement , with the commencement of a violent frontier conflict in which Pemulwuy and his Bidjigal clan played a central role . On 1 May 1801 Governor King took drastic action , issuing a public order requiring that Aboriginal people around Parramatta , Prospect Hill and Georges River should be driven back from the settlers habitations by firing at them . Kings edicts appear to have encouraged a shoot-on-sight attitude whenever any Aboriginal men , women or children appeared . With the death of Pemulwuy , the main resistance leader , in 1802 , Aboriginal resistance gradually diminished near Parramatta , although outer areas were still subject to armed hostilities . Prompted by suggestions to the Reverend Marsden by local Prospect Aboriginal groups that a conference should take place with a view of opening the way to reconciliation , Marsden promptly organised a meeting near Prospect Hill . At the meeting , held on 3 May 1805 , local Aboriginal representatives discussed with Marsden ways of ending the restrictions and indiscriminate reprisals inflicted on them by soldiers and settlers in response to atrocities committed by other Aboriginal clans . The meeting was significant because a group of Aboriginal women and a young free settler at Prospect named John Kennedy acted as intermediaries . The conference led to the end of the conflict for the Aboriginal clans around Parramatta and Prospect . This conference at Prospect on Friday 3 May 1805 is a landmark in Aboriginal/European relations . Macquaries Native Feasts held at Parramatta from 1814 followed the precedent set in 1805 . The Sydney Gazette report of the meeting is notable for the absence of the sneering tone that characterised its earlier coverage of Aboriginal matters . From its commencement in 1791 with the early settlement of the area , agricultural use of the land continued at Prospect Hill . Much of the land appears to have been cleared by the 1820s and pastoral use of the land was well established by then . When Governor Macquarie paid a visit to the area in 1810 , he was favourably impressed by the comfortable conditions that had been created . Nelson Lawson , third son of explorer William Lawson ( 1774-1850 ) , married Honoria Mary Dickinson and before 1837 built Greystanes House as their future family home on the western side of Prospect Hill . Lawson had received the land from his father , who had been granted here by the illegal government that followed the overthrow of Governor Bligh in 1808 . Governor Macquarie confirmed the grant , where William Lawson had built a house , which he called Veteran Hall , because he had a commission in the NSW Veterans Company . The house was demolished in 1928 and the site is now partly covered by the waters of Prospect Reservoir . Greystanes was approached by a long drive lined with an avenue of English trees - elms ( Ulmus procera ) , hawthorns ( Crataegus sp. ) , holly ( Ilex aquifolium ) , and woodbine ( Clematis sp. ) mingling with jacarandas ( Jacaranda mimosifolia ) . It had a wide , semi-circular front verandah supported by four pillars . The foundations were of stone , the roof of slate , and the doors and architraves of heavy red cedar . It was richly furnished with articles of the best quality available and was the scene of many glittering soirees attended by the elite of the colony . Honoria Lawson died in 1845 , Nelson remarried a year later , but died in 1849 , and the property reverted to his father . Greystanes house was demolished in the 1940s . By the 1870s , with the collapse of the production of cereal grains across the Cumberland Plain , the Prospect Hill area appears to have largely been devoted to livestock . The dwellings of the earliest settlers largely appear to have been removed by this stage . By the time that any mapping was undertaken in this vicinity , most of these structures had disappeared , making their locations difficult to pinpoint . The land was farmed from 1806 to 1888 when the Prospect Reservoir was built . In 1867 , the Governor of New South Wales appointed a Commission to recommend a scheme for Sydneys water supply , and by 1869 it was recommended that construction commence on the Upper Nepean Scheme . This consisted of two diversion weirs , located at Pheasants Nest and Broughtons Pass , in the Upper Nepean River catchment , with water feeding into a series of tunnels , canals and aqueducts known as the Upper Canal . It was intended that water be fed by gravity from the catchment into a reservoir at Prospect . This scheme was to be Sydneys fourth water supply system , following the Tank Stream , Busbys Bore and the Botany ( Lachlan ) Swamps . Designed and constructed by the NSW Public Works Department , Prospect Reservoir was built during the 1880s and completed in 1888 . Credit for the Upper Nepean Scheme is largely given to Edward Orpen Moriarty , the Engineer in Chief of the Harbours and Rivers Branch of the Public Works Department from 1858 to 1888 . St . Bartholemews Church . Prior to 1836 the building of churches in New South Wales had been a haphazard responsibility of the government . In 1836 the Church Act came into force to promote the building of churches and chapels and provide for the maintenance of Ministers of Religion . The Act immediately led to a spate of church building . St . Bartholemews Church of England was built by pioneers of Prospect with funds collected from 1837 . In August 1838 tenders were called for the construction of St Bartholomews Church . The contract was won by James Atkinson of Mulgoa who was building three other churches at the same time : St Peters at Richmond , St Mary Magdalene at St Marys and St Thomas at Mulgoa . His contract was with the trustees , William Lawson , Robert Crawford and Nelson Simmons Lawson . The original contract sum for the building was A£1,250 , half of which was borne by private subscription and half by the Colonial Treasury . Henry Robertson is thought to have been the architect for the building although it is highly possible that William Lawson , a surveyor by training , was designer of the church . Lawson ( 1774-1850 ) who crossed the Blue Mountains with Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth in 1813 , lived in a house in Prospect called Veteran Hall ( Lawson was a lieutenant in the NSW Veterans Company , hence the name ) . Built in 1810 as a small cottage , it was extended to a forty-room mansion in 1822 . Lawsons descendants continued to improve the house until the 1880s . It was demolished in 1926 and its site is now within the Prospect Reservoir grounds . Lawson married Sarah Leadbeater on Norfolk Island while serving there and they had 11 children between 1803 and 1826 . William Lawson was buried on 16 June 1850 . One of their daughters , Sophia , was born at Prospect , and when she died in 1906 , was the last surviving child . The family vault at St . Bartholemews shelters the remains of several members of this large family . In April/May 1841 the church and cemetery were consecrated . The earliest burials , on 18 July 1841 , were Ann and Margaret Goodin , the 25 and 9 year old daughters of early settlers James and Ann Goodin . The first minutes of the vestry meeting are dated 1842 and refer to the opening of the parish registers by the Rev . H . H . Bobart , who was the rector of St . Johns , Parramatta . By 1891 over 360 burials had been recorded in the Parish Register . From the turn of the century to 1941 there was a substantial increase in the annual number of burials , reflecting the development of the district with the subdivision of farms into suburban allotments , the encroaching metropolitan area and the industrial development with the development of metal quarries , saw mills , brick and tile works and Bonds cotton spinning mills . Burials are now only permitted in previously purchased plots , the sale of which were discontinued in 1992 and in existing graves where there is space . Two burials are permitted in most plots . The condition of the church deteriorated throughout the mid-twentieth century , and a dwindling congregation and lack of financial support led to its closure in 1967 . The last service was held on Christmas Eve that year . A group of citizens interested in preserving the church formed The Prospect Trust in November 1967 under the chairmanship of Robert Brown . In late 1969 the City of Blacktown commenced negotiations with the Church of England Property Trust . A fifty-year lease over most of the property was obtained by Council in 1975 . In 1978 $20,000 was made available from National Estate Funds towards restoration provided the funds be administered by the National Trust of Australia . In 1982 a Permanent Conservation order was placed on the site . A further $100,000 were allocated for restoration by the Minister for Public Works subject to Blacktown Council meeting this amount on a dollar for dollar basis . Blacktown Council requested the Ministers offer be deferred until Council had negotiated the leasing arrangement into purchase of the building by them or the Department of Environment and Planning . Fire destroyed much of the contents of the church and severely damaged the roof in November 1989 . Parts of the original box pews and joinery , an 1850s organ brought to St Bartholomews in 1888 , a pulpit and lecterns from 1908 and all pressed metal ceilings were lost . In 1991 work commenced to repair the roof and brickwork damaged by the fire . From 2000 to 2001 the Church was completely restored , including interiors and windows with the use of Centenary of Federation funding . The restoration received an EnergyAustralia National Trust Heritage Award in 2004 . In October 2015 , the state government gave the City of Blacktown a parcel of land surrounding the cemetery , allowing the council to proceed with plans to extend the cemetery to meet the needs of the areas growing population . , this has not yet taken place , with the Council continuing to advertise that no new burial licenses can be purchased , with burials only able to take place where rights were purchased prior to 1992 .

Site . St Bartholomews stands on the hill for which the district is famous - Prospect Hill . It is a conspicuous landmark from which there are fine views from to the Blue Mountains and the City of Sydney . Several mature trees including Mediterranean cypress ( Cupressus sempervirens ) , arborvitae ( Thuja species ) , coral trees ( Erythrina species , possibly E.indica ) , Moreton Bay figs ( Ficus macrophylla ) , gums ( Eucalyptus spp. ) , and Bunya pine ( Araucaria bidwillii ) , and African olive ( Olea europaea var.africana ) clumps are found alongside the fence at either side of the entrance gates to the church . Remnants of early post and rail fencing and entrance gateposts are also found . Lower plantings include variegated century plant ( Agave americana Variegata ) . The church is surrounded by a graveyard laid out in a grid pattern . It contains sandstone headstones and columns and small headstones in marble and granite , many originally bordered by cast iron surrounds . Church . The building is a plain , rectangular brick structure in the Victorian Georgian style , built on an east–west axis comprising nave , chancel and vestries with a tower at the west end . The tower has a square base with an octagonal belfry . The belfry roof timbers carry a timber bell supporting frame although no bell is in place . The roof over the chancel and vestries is separate from the main roof over the nave . The entrance to the building is through the tower . There are also entrances to the vestries from the exterior . The external walls are modelled by flat pilasters and finely moulded stone entablatures carried on carved stone modillion brackets , rectangular openings and blind windows . The hipped roof , originally shingled , is now clad with corrugated steel . The interior joinery was finely moulded cedar and the interior walls plastered and painted . Each vestry had a fireplace but the chimneys and mantelpieces have now been removed . The floors are timber . The chancel floor , originally one step above the main floor , has been raised further and a rectangular projecting dais into the main hall added . There is also a small dais in the north western corner of the church on which a font was once placed . Church Hall . The church hall , relocated from its original location in Wetherill Park in 1908 , is a one-storey , rectangular building . The exterior walls are corrugated iron over timber framing and the interior walls are timber boarded . The roof is corrugated steel over timber rafters with metal rods . The hall is on a brick base and may have been a prefabricated building . Condition . The physical condition of the site was reported to be good to excellent as at 9 August 2005 . Some elements have been removed for their protection and preservation . There are some problems involved in reinstating them . Heritage listing . The St Bartholomews site is closely linked with the development and history of the surrounding area and contains the graves of a considerable number of prominent families from the area since the 1840s . The church is unusually styled for its period and the graveyard is one of the earliest in western Sydney . St . Bartholomews remains a dominant landmark in the surrounding landscape due to its prominent siting , striking design and mature tree plantings . St Bartholomews Anglican Church &amp; Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria . The place is important in demonstrating the course , or pattern , of cultural or natural history in New South Wales . The cemetery contains the graves of a number of prominent families and individuals from the founders of the community , including the Lawsons of Veteran Hall ( Blaxland , Lawson and Wentworth ) and the Westons , through to the more recent sporting fame of the Heckenbergs . It demonstrates important family lineages across its entire site from the earliest settlers to their more recent descendants , such as the Leabon and Pond families . The church is an unusually detailed and planned church . The division of the east end into three separately roofed compartments may be the only extant example in NSW of this design . It therefore occupies a special position in the architectural evolution of churches in NSW . The church hall provides an element associated with the construction of Prospect Reservoir , a major engineering achievement within the district . The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales . The site is an important surviving fragment of nineteenth century cultural landscape ; an historic icon ; a virtual oasis , and de facto public heritage green space , in a once notable rural area now surrounded by the effects of rapid urban , industrial and commercial development . It reflects a visual continuity between 19th and 20th century society . This may be seen not only in the chronological continuity of family burials , but also dramatically in the direct accommodation of power transmission towers , the F4 tollway , the modern Great Western Highway route and the first Great Western Highway route . The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social , cultural or spiritual reasons . The church is a building closely linked with the development and early history of the district . The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .

He served as leader of the National Party of Australia from 1971 to 1984 and was the second and longest-serving Deputy Prime Minister , holding the position under John Gorton ( 1971 ) , William McMahon ( 1971–1972 ) and Malcolm Fraser ( 1975–1983 ) . Anthony was born in Murwillumbah , New South Wales , the son of federal government minister Hubert Lawrence Anthony . He was elected to the House of Representatives at a 1957 by-election , aged 27 , following his fathers sudden death . He was appointed to the ministry in 1964 and in Coalition governments over the following 20 years held the portfolios of Minister for the Interior ( 1964–1967 ) , Primary Industry ( 1967–1971 ) , Trade and Industry ( 1971–1972 ) , Overseas Trade ( 1975–1977 ) , National Resources ( 1975–1977 ) , and Trade and Resources ( 1977–1983 ) . Anthony was elected deputy leader of the Country Party in 1964 and succeeded John McEwen as party leader and deputy prime minister in 1971 . He retired from politics at the 1984 election . His son Larry Anthony became the third generation of his family to enter federal parliament . Early life . Anthony was born in Murwillumbah in northern New South Wales , on 31 December 1929 , the son of Jessie Anthony ( ) and Hubert Lawrence ( Larry ) Anthony , a well-known Country Party politician . Doug Anthony was educated at Murwillumbah Primary School and Murwillumbah High School , before attending The Kings School in Sydney ( 1943–1946 ) and then Gatton College in Queensland . After graduating he took up dairy farming near Murwillumbah . In 1957 he married Margot Budd , with whom he had three children : Dougald , Jane and Larry . Political career . Early career ( 1957–1964 ) . In 1957 Larry Anthony Sr. , who was Postmaster-General in the Liberal–Country Party coalition government led by Robert Menzies , died suddenly , and Doug Anthony was elected to succeed his father in the ensuing by-election for the Division of Richmond , aged 27 . He was appointed Minister for the Interior in 1964 by Menzies in a reshuffle , replacing Senator John Gorton . Minister for the Interior ( 1964–1967 ) . During his tenure in the Interior portfolio , there were several pushes for Canberra to become independent and self-governing in some capacity . The Menzies government had not yet established a clear policy for Canberras future , and Anthony stated that the city was not yet ready for self-governance . At Narrogin in August 1966 , Anthony relayed to several rural communities that drought would probably soon sweep the region , and that he was prepared to take precautions to prevent as many negative effects as possible . He was unable to comment on protests that took place outside the Canberra Hotel on 2 February 1967 . Anthony was one of the leading forces against the 1967 nexus referendum , which was seeking to increase the senates power in parliament . Senator Vince Gair revived the debate around the introduction of such a law in early 1967 . Anthony and the County Party decided it would be “unwise” to increase the power of the upper house . Towards the end of his term as Minister for the Interior , Anthony supported a federal redistribution with conditions so restrictive that it favoured country seats and would increase Country Party representation . Splits within the Liberal and Country coalition were causing such issues to be raised and considered by parliament . These tensions were also fuelled by the narrow majority with which the Liberal Party was returned to power in the 1963 election ; without Country Party support they could not have guaranteed parliamentary supply . In 1967 he became Minister for Primary Industry . Minister for Primary Industry ( 1967–1971 ) . His first speech in this portfolio was made regarding the wheat price in Australia . 1966–67 had yielded a smaller amount than the 1965–66 season , and accordingly the price of wheat had to be raised . Controversially , in May 1968 , Anthony initiated a payout of $21 million to offset the devaluation of the British Pound by Prime Minister Harold Wilson ; the currencies were not yet independent of each other . Anthonys popularity in the Industry portfolio was damaged when rural production was down $450 million in 1968 and little change had occurred in the return that farmers were getting for production . Anthony worked with Prime Minister John Gorton to try to create as many economically viable options as possible to deal with the “wheat crisis” . Eventually quotas were introduced to limit production . When China stopped importing Australian wheat in 1971 , Anthony advised against communication with the country , saying it could be “politically and commercially dangerous . Deputy Prime Minister ( 1971–1972 ) . By mid-1969 , it was thought that John McEwen , leader of the Country Party since 1958 , was going to retire sometime in late 1970 . The three members of the party considered to have the greatest chance of succeeding McEwen as leader were Anthony , Shipping Minister Ian Sinclair and Interior Minister Peter Nixon . When McEwen retired in 1971 , Anthony was chosen as his successor , taking McEwens old posts of Minister for Trade and Industry and Deputy Prime Minister in the government of John Gorton , portfolios he retained under William McMahon . Anthony was made a Privy Councillor by Queen Elizabeth II on 23 June 1971 . When McMahon became Prime Minister in March 1971 , only a month after Anthony had taken the Deputy Prime Minister position , Anthony lost power as McMahon disliked him and the two had a poor working relationship . Anthony opposed the revaluation of the Australian dollar by McMahon in 1971–72 . In mid-1972 , McMahon stopped talking to Anthony and he was oblivious to many decisions that were occurring outside cabinet . When McMahon announced the 1972 election , he left Anthony in the dark and he was unaware of the date on which it would take place and the campaign techniques the coalition would use . Anthony called the Prime Minister of New Zealand , Jack Marshall , to find out the date , as McMahon had only informed three people of the date before approaching the Governor-General . Anthony lost faith in the government and became complacent about the defeat which became obvious in the lead up to the election in December 1972 . Opposition ( 1972–1975 ) . After McMahons defeat in 1972 , Anthony was said to favour a policy of absolute opposition to the Labor government of Gough Whitlam . Despite that , the Country Party voted with the Labor Government on some bills , for example the 1973 expansion of state aid to under-privileged schools . Under Anthonys leadership , the partys name was changed to the National Country Party and it began contesting urban seats in Queensland and Western Australia . There was also a weakening in the partys relationship with primary producer organisations . In 1975 , Anthony , along with other senior Opposition members , criticised Whitlam for not giving enough aid to Papua New Guinea . Deputy Prime Minister ( 1975–1983 ) . Anthony had a much better working relationship with Malcolm Fraser than he did with Billy Snedden . At first , Anthony did not support Sneddens or Frasers decisions to block parliamentary supply from the Labor Party , beginning in October 1975 , though he was soon convinced otherwise . The Coalition was confirmed in power at the 1975 election , with the biggest majority government in Australian history . Though from 1975 to 1980 the Liberals won enough seats to form government in their own right , Fraser opted to retain the Coalition with the NCP . Anthony again became Deputy Prime Minister , with the portfolios of Overseas Trade and National Resources ( Trade and Resources from 1977 ) . Anthony was noted , while Prime Minister Fraser took annual Christmas holidays , for governing the country as Acting Prime Minister from a caravan in his electorate of Richmond . In 1976 , during his second term as Deputy Prime Minister , Anthony began a strong import and export relationship with Japan , particularly over oil . Anthony supported the mining and export of Australian uranium , and believed it would be an essential part of the future economy . While Acting Prime Minister in July 1976 , he was the first user of the Papua New Guinea–Cairns telephone line , speaking to Acting Prime Minister Sir Maori Kiki . While Acting Prime Minister in July 1979 , he threatened to shut down an industrial strike in Western Australia , stating the issue had to be resolved . The Labor Party was strongly opposed to this action and called his power as Acting Prime Minister into question . After Fraser lost office in 1983 , Anthony remained as party leader ( since 1974 named the National Party ) . The last major move as leader of the National Party that Anthony made was to explain the tensions between the Liberal and National parties in Queensland , who officially opposed each other in the October 1983 election . Retirement . Anthony remained in parliament for less than a year before retiring from politics in 1984 . By then , although only 55 , he was the Father of the House of Representatives . He returned to his farm near Murwillumbah and generally stayed out of politics . In 1996 , Larry Anthony won his fathers old seat . In 1994 , Anthony appeared in a documentary series about the Liberal Party in which he revealed that McMahon had refused to tell him beforehand the date of the 1972 election , despite Anthony being the Country Party leader . During 1999 , Anthony spoke in support of Australia becoming a republic . Anthony died at an aged care home in Murwillumbah , on 20 December 2020 , at the age of 90 , 11 days before his 91st birthday . Until his death , he was the earliest-elected Country MP still alive , and along with his deputy and successor as National Party leader , Ian Sinclair , he was one of the last two surviving ministers who served in the Menzies Government and the First Holt Ministry . Honours . In 1981 Anthony was appointed a Companion of Honour ( CH ) . In 1990 , he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal . In 2003 he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia ( AC ) for service to the Australian Parliament , for forging the development of bi-lateral trade agreements , and for continued leadership and dedication to the social , educational , health and development needs of rural and regional communities .</p><p>question: What position did Doug Anthony take from Nov 1975 to Mar 1983?</p><p>pred: Deputy Prime Minister</p><p>context_time: John Douglas Anthony , ( 31 December 192920 December 2020 ) was an Australian politician .

In 1851 he was compelled , owing to increasing blindness , to retire from his medical practice , but he lived , carefully tended by his daughters , at Weinsberg until his death . He was buried beside his wife , who had died in 1854 , in the graveyard of Weinsberg , and the grave is marked by a stone slab with an inscription he himself had chosen : Friederike Kerner und ihr Justinus . Association with George Rapp and the Harmony Society . In Bilderbuch aus meiner Knabenzeit , Kerner recalls George Rapps visits to his father , the Oberamtmann at Maulbronn . Kerners father had helped shield Rapp from religious prosecution by the authorities in Germany , and Kerner well remembered Rapp and his long black beard . George Rapp and his followers eventually left Germany in 1803 , settled in the United States , and started the Harmony Society . Die Seherin von Prevorst and its tale about Kerners relationship with Friederike Hauffe — the latter reputed to have visionary and healing powers , and who had produced a strange inner language containing Hebrew-like elements — made quite an impression among the members of the Harmony Society in 1829 , who saw it as confirmation of the approaching millennium and of their religious views . Evaluations . - Kerner was one of the most inspired poets of the Swabian school . His poems , which largely deal with natural phenomena , are characterized by a deep melancholy and a leaning towards the supernatural , which , however , is balanced by a quaint humour , reminiscent of the Volkslied . — 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica - The poems and dramatic scenes of his Reiseschatten are characterized by a dreamy fancy and a peculiar fantastic humor . — New International Encyclopedia - He was at times morbid , fanciful , dreamy , sensitive and poetic and endowed with a strange , fantastic humor . . . — 1920 Encyclopedia Americana The Saw . The Saw was translated by William Cullen Bryant and was included in Grahams Magazine in 1848 . Cultural references . - Robert Schumann set Kerners poems in his Opus 35 , 12 Gedichte von Justinus Kerner , composed in 1840 and dedicated to “Dr . Friedrich Weber in London.” Schumann called the set a Liederreihe , or row of songs . - The poet Thomas Medwin stayed with him during 1848 to 1849 and later wrote a poem in his honour , To Justinus Kerner : With a Painted Wreath of Bay-Leaves , published in London in 1854 . - The grape variety Kerner , bred in 1929 , was named in his honour . - Søren Kierkegaard wrote in his journal on Kerner : - “I cannot help being amazed that Justinus Kerner ( in his Dichtungen ) is able to interpret so conciliatingly the phenomenon which has always shocked me since my very first experience of it — that someone says just exactly what I say . To me the phenomenon seemed to be the most confusing , almost Punch-and-Judy , disorder : the one would begin a sentence which the other would finish , and no one could be sure who was speaking.” July 11 , 1837Journals 2539 - “Justinus Kerner has interested me so much just now because , although he is far more gifted , I see in him the same artistic barrenness I see in myself . But I also see how something can be done even though essential continuity is lacking and can be fulfilled only by continuity of mood , of which every single little idea is a blossom , a kind of novelistic aphorism , a plastic study . While his own Dichtungen are full of excellent imaginative ideas , his reports aus dem Nachtgebiete der Natur are so dry that we could almost take that to be indirect proof of their truth.” July 13 , 1837Journals 5240 References . - Attribution - This work in turn cites : - Strauss , “Justinus Kerner,” in Kleine Schriften ( Berlin , 1866 ) - A .

She held a number of major government ministerial positions , as well as opposition appointments , during this period . She served as Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport from 2001 to 2007 and Minister for the Cabinet Office from 2009 to 2010 . A member of both the Blair and Brown Cabinets , she was also Minister for the Olympics ( 2005–10 ) and Shadow Minister for the Olympics and Shadow Minister for London until September 2012 , resigning after the London Olympic Games . A Privy Councillor from 1998 , she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( DBE ) in 2012 . She stood down from the House of Commons at the 2015 general election . She was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and was raised to the peerage as Baroness Jowell , of Brixton in the London Borough of Lambeth , on 27 October 2015 . In September 2015 , she was unsuccessful in seeking to be selected as the Labour Partys official candidate in the 2016 London mayoral election , coming second to Sadiq Khan in the contest of six candidates . Early life . Tessa Jane Helen Douglas Palmer was born at Middlesex Hospital in Marylebone , London , to Kenneth Nelson Veysey Palmer , a physician , and his wife , Rosemary ( née Douglas ) , a radiographer . She was educated at the independent St Margarets School for Girls in Aberdeen , the University of Aberdeen ( where she studied arts , psychology and sociology ) and the University of Edinburgh ( where she studied for an MA in Social Administration ) . She became a social worker , initially working in the Craigmillar area of Edinburgh and as a childcare officer in Lambeth , before training at Goldsmiths College as a psychiatric social worker . She subsequently worked at the Maudsley Hospital , and later became assistant director of the mental health charity Mind . During this time , Jowell took her first steps into electoral politics , being elected to represent Swiss Cottage on Camden London Borough Council in the early 1970s , and becoming Chair of the Camden Borough Councils Social Services Committee at the age of 25 . In 1978 , she was the Labour Party candidate in a by-election in Ilford North but lost Labours majority to the Conservatives . She stood again in Ilford North at the 1979 general election , also unsuccessfully . Member of Parliament . Elected as MP for Dulwich at the 1992 general election , Jowell was successively appointed as an Opposition Spokesperson on Health , an Opposition Whip and Spokesperson on Women , before returning to the Shadow Health team in 1996 . After boundary changes , she was the MP for Dulwich and West Norwood from 1997 . In government . Jowell was appointed as Minister of State in the Department of Health after the 1997 Labour electoral landslide . As the first Minister for Public Health she championed cross-sectoral action to improve health and reduce inequalities , initially set out in her green paper Our Healthier Nation . She moved , again as Minister of State , to the Department for Education and Employment in 1999 . She was appointed Secretary of State at the Department for Culture , Media and Sport after the 2001 election , replacing the sacked Chris Smith . One of her main concerns as Culture Secretary was television broadcasting . She blocked the BBCs plans for the digital channel BBC3 , on the grounds that they were insufficiently different from commercial offerings , and imposed extra conditions on BBC News 24 after it was criticized on the same grounds by the Lambert Report . She was responsible for the Communications Act 2003 which established a new media regulator , OFCOM . It also relaxed regulations on ownership of British television stations , though , following a rebellion in the House of Lords , a public interest test was introduced as a compromise . In July 2003 , she launched an overhaul of the National Lottery . She dealt with complaints that the lottery had been directed to fund programmes that should have been covered by mainstream taxation . In 2001 Arts Council England announced changes to how funding would be distributed and she supported this . She oversaw the restructuring of the Arts funding system but lost out in the 2004/5 spending round , when there was a cut in her departmental budget . In 2004 a tax loophole was closed around film production in Britain . In 2004 , Jowell faced resistance to proposals for a series of so-called super casinos , to be sanctioned as part of the Gambling Act 2005 which liberalised Britains gaming laws . Although some argued that problem gambling had ruined the lives of many ordinary people , in the run up to the Bill , Jowell dismissed much of the criticism as being elitist , commenting that opponents of the Governments gambling reforms are snobs who want to deny ordinary people the right to bet . Former Labour Welfare Minister Frank Field said her comments were crass , declaring , I think this whole New Labour line that you insult people rather than engage in argument is deeply disturbing . In March 2005 , Jowell announced a new governance system for the BBC : the BBC Trust , to replace the long-established Board of Governors . The trust was introduced in 2007 but in 2012 was shown to be not fit for purpose , leading to the resignation of the Director General . In Gordon Browns reshuffle in June 2007 , following his succession as Labour leader and Prime Minister , Jowell was demoted from her position as Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport . She retained her Olympics portfolio , however , and was also appointed Paymaster General and Minister for London , being allowed to attend Cabinet , although not as a full member . She was further demoted on 3 October 2008 , losing her Minister for London role to Tony McNulty , and being allowed to attend cabinet only when her area of responsibility was on the agenda . In his 2009 reshuffle , Brown reappointed her to the Cabinet as Minister for the Cabinet Office . In the 2012 Birthday Honours , Jowell was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( DBE ) for political and charitable services , in particular for her contribution to delivering the London 2012 Olympics . Political positions . Jowell was a zealous supporter of the then Prime Minister Tony Blair , reportedly saying on one occasion that she would jump under a bus for him . She was very supportive of New Labour and was fully loyal to its agenda , earning herself a strong reputation as a Blairite . In 2007 , she supported Hazel Blears for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party . In 2009 , she was mentioned as a possible Cabinet minister who might resign over the leadership of Gordon Brown in order to trigger a leadership contest – a suggestion which proved unfounded . In opposition , Jowell supported David Milibands campaign to become Leader of the Labour Party , but served in Ed Milibands Shadow Cabinet when he became Leader of HM Opposition . In 2010 she briefly appeared as a landmark on Google Maps , as a result of a prank . She was involved in the Blue Labour movement in the Labour Party , and was a contributor to The Purple Book , drawing on her background on the Right of the Labour Party . Jowell set up the Sure Start programme , Jowell said , I am very proud of setting up Sure Start [ the national nurture and childcare programme ] , because the first three years of a child’s life are absolutely critical in determining the chances they have subsequently . London 2012 Olympics . Jowell was in charge of Londons successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics . She came up with the idea in 2002 , during her time as Culture Secretary , when she said there was very little support from within the Cabinet , with many colleagues thinking that Paris bid would win . Jowell convinced the Government to support the bid , however , and went ahead with it . In 2004 , she launched the bid and , when the Games were awarded to London , she was appointed Olympics Minister ( in addition to her responsibilities as Culture Secretary ) , and held full ministerial responsibility for the bid from 2006 . Despite being moved from the Department for Culture , Media and Sport in 2007 , she retained her position as Olympics Minister throughout Labours time in office . Following the general election of May 2010 , at which Labour lost power , she became Shadow Olympics Minister . She remained on the 2012 Olympics Organising Committee , with Lord Coe and Jeremy Hunt . She was appointed Deputy Mayor of the Olympics Village , being responsible for making the Olympics take place . She resigned her role as Shadow Minister for the Olympics in September 2012 , and returned to the House of Commons backbenches . After the House of Commons . In November 2013 , Jowell announced that she would not contest the next general election . In May 2015 , she launched her campaign to be selected as the Labour Partys official candidate in the 2016 election for Mayor of London . Six candidates stood for selection and in September the process concluded with her coming second to Sadiq Khan . She was nominated for life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours by the Labour leader . She was raised to the peerage as Baroness Jowell , of Brixton in the London Borough of Lambeth , on 27 October 2015 . In January 2018 , Jowell got a standing ovation in the House of Lords for a speech . She began by speaking of how she came to be diagnosed with an extremely lethal form of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme . She went on to advocate making more cancer treatments available in the NHS . She said , In the end , what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived , but how it draws to a close . I hope that this debate will give hope to other cancer patients , like me , so that we can live well together with cancer , not just dying of it . All of us , for longer . Controversies . Jowell , Mills and Berlusconi . Jowells husband David Mills was an international corporate lawyer who has acted for Silvio Berlusconi , then the Italian Prime Minister . Mills was investigated in Italy for money laundering and alleged tax fraud . Jowell was investigated by the Cabinet Secretary Gus ODonnell over the allegations surrounding her husband , because of a possible conflict of interest between her personal life and ministerial duties . ODonnell stated that , it is the Prime Minister , not me , who , constitutionally , is the right and proper person to take a view on matters arising based on the Ministerial Code in his letter , and Tony Blair decided that she was not in breach of the ministers code of conduct . On 4 March 2006 , it was announced that Jowell and Mills had separated , after the allegations had begun to damage her political standing . Jowell said although we are separated I have never doubted his innocence . Scepticism that Jowell was unaware of the details of her husbands dealings with Berlusconi led to a Private Eye front cover of her with a speech bubble saying : I have never met my husband . Mills allegedly admitted to being an idiot , and has expressed his remorse about the impact of his dealings upon his wife . The separation had effectively ended by September 2012 . On 17 February 2009 , an Italian court sentenced Mills to four years and six months in jail after finding him guilty of accepting a bribe from Berlusconi to give false evidence on his behalf during corruption trials which had taken place in 1997 and 1998 . His defence counsel said that the sentence went against the logic and dynamic of the evidence presented . The judgment was appealed by Mills . On 27 October 2009 , the Italian Appeal Court upheld his conviction and prison sentence . Mills confirmed that he would initiate a second and final appeal to the Cassation Court . On 25 February 2010 , the Italian Cassation Court ( the second and last court of appeal under Italian law ) dissolved the case because of the statute of limitations . For this type of crime , in Italian law , a case expires after 10 years . Mills argued that he received the money in 1999 , and not 2000 as Prosecutors had previously argued , thus taking advantage of the statute of limitations . Other controversies . In 2001 , Jowell was widely criticised for interfering in Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) rulings on complaints regarding Brass Eye . The Guardian newspaper suggested that for the Culture Secretary to speak directly to the head of a TV network about a specific programme smacks of the Soviet commissar and the state broadcaster . The ITC reminded Jowell that she should not be interfering in their processes , resulting in a Channel Four interviewer suggesting Jowell and her colleagues must feel like idiots . In 2006 , Jowell was criticised for projected cost over-runs on the London 2012 Summer Olympics project , which came under the supervision of her former department . She was among a number of ministers accused of hypocrisy for opposing Post Office closures in their own constituencies while supporting the governments closure strategy at the national level . Jowell was Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport during the News of the World newspaper phone-hacking scandal ( pre-2007 ) . In January 2007 , Clive Goodman , the News of the Worlds royal editor , was jailed for four months , and Glenn Mulcaire , a private investigator employed by the News of the World , was jailed for six months . In May 2014 a temporary personal assistant to Richard Scudamore , chief executive of Englands Premier League , read private emails between Scudamore and colleagues and friends . These included comments about womens football , which the assistant felt to be inappropriate . She passed them on to a national newspaper , the Daily Mirror . Jowell defended the reading and passing-on of the emails , declaring that , in the world of social media and email , there is no public and private . Leadership fellow . Jowell served as a Richard L . and Ronay A . Menschel Senior Leadership Fellow at Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health in 2016 . In this role , she taught a course in the Department of Health Policy and Management called , Health Policy and Leadership : Why do we know so much and do so little ? Jowell also actively served on the Advisory Board of the Ministerial Leadership in Health Program , a joint initiative of the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health and the John F . Kennedy School of Government . Personal life . Jowells first marriage was to fellow Camden Councillor Roger Jowell in 1970 ; this was dissolved in 1976 , but she continued to use his surname . Roger Jowell co-founded and directed Social &amp; Community Planning Research ( SCPR ) , now the National Centre for Social Research , known for its British Social Attitudes Surveys . She married David Mills on 17 March 1979 . They separated in March 2006 , following the controversy over Millss links to Berlusconi . Their professed hopes to restore their relationship over time , rather than seek divorce , caused some to regard this as a politically expedient gesture to save her political career . Jowell said on Radio 4s Womans Hour programme in September 2012 that she was seeing Mills regularly , saying that they had reached a state of stability which I never thought possible . She had a son and daughter , as well as three stepchildren ( including journalist Eleanor Mills ) from her husbands first marriage . In April 2016 , her son Matthew Mills married food writer Ella Woodward , who is also his business partner . Her daughter Jess Mills is a singer . In January 2011 , during the News of the World phone hacking affair , it was revealed that Jowell had contacted lawyers as she attempted to find out who hacked into her voicemails on 28 separate occasions during 2006 . Jowell contacted police in late January 2011 to inform them that there had recently been an unsuccessful attempt to listen to voicemail messages on her phone . Illness and death . On her 70th birthday on 17 September 2017 , her family made public the news that she had been suffering from a brain tumour since May of that year . On her Twitter account , she stated Thank you for so much love and support on my birthday . More people living longer better lives with cancer is my birthday pledge . Jowell wanted more treatment for cancer patients , knowledge about cancer treatment shared more effectively , speedier diagnosis , greater access to experimental treatments , and improved survival rates . After Jowells death , Downing Street announced that in tribute to her , brain cancer government funding would be doubled and the so-called gold standard dye tumour diagnosis tests would be extended to all NHS hospitals . Jowell died at her family home in Shipston-on-Stour on 12 May 2018 , after suffering a brain haemorrhage the day before and then falling into a coma . Honours and styles .

Biography . Fechter was born , probably in London , of French parents , although his mother was of Piedmontese and his father of German extraction . As a boy he had ambitions to be a sculptor but discovered his talent accidentally while appearing in some private theatricals . In 1841 he joined a travelling company that was going to Italy . The tour was a failure , and the company broke up ; Fechter returned home and resumed the study of sculpture . At the same time he attended classes at the Conservatoire with the view of gaining admission to the Comédie-Française . Late in 1844 he won the grand medal of the Académie des Beaux-Arts with a piece of sculpture , and made his debut at the Comédie-Française as Seide in Voltaires Mahomet and Valère in Molières Tartuffe . He acquitted himself with credit ; but , tired of the small parts he found himself condemned to play , returned again to his sculptors studio in 1846 . In the same year he was invited to appear with a French company in Berlin , where he made his first decisive success as an actor . On his return to Paris in the following year he married the actress Eléonore Rabut ( d . 1895 ) . Previously he had appeared for some months in London , in a season of French classical plays given at the St Jamess Theatre . In Paris for the next ten years he fulfilled a series of successful engagements at various theatres , his chief triumph being his creation at the Vaudeville on 2 February 1852 of the part of Armand Duval in La Dame aux camélias . For nearly two years ( 1857–1858 ) Fechter was manager of the Odéon , where he produced Tartuffe and other classical plays . Having received tempting offers to act in English at the Princesss Theatre , London , he made a diligent study of the English language , and appeared there on 27 October 1860 in an English version of Victor Hugos Ruy Blas . This was followed by The Corsican Brothers and Don César de Bazan ; and on 20 March 1861 , he attempted Hamlet for the first time . The result was an extraordinary triumph , the play running for 115 nights . This was followed by Othello , in which he played alternately the Moor and Iago . In 1863 he became lessee of the Lyceum Theatre , which he opened with The Dukes Motto ; this was followed by The Kings Butterfly , The Mountebank ( in which his son Paul , a boy of seven , appeared ) , The Roadside Inn , The Master of Ravenswood , The Corsican Brothers ( in the original French version , in which he had created the parts of Louis and Fabian dei Franchi ) and The Lady of Lyons . After this he appeared at the Adelphi Theatre ( 1868 ) as Obenreizer in No Thoroughfare , by Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins , as Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo , and as Count de Leyrac in Black and White , a play in which the actor himself collaborated with Wilkie Collins . In 1870 he visited the United States , where ( with the exception of a visit to London in 1872 ) he remained till his death . He played in the United States between 1870 and 1876 in most of the parts in which he had won his chief triumphs in Britain . His first appearance in New York was at Niblos Garden in the title role of Hugos Ruy Blas in January 1870 . He leased the Globe Theatre at 730 Broadway in September 1870 . The experiment was brief . Fechters imperious temper , aggravated by indulgence in drink , involved him in private quarrels and in discussions in the press , and he left in January 1871 . He then had the same experiences at the old French theatre , renamed the Lyceum Theatre that year , and also in Boston . He then went into a brief partnership with William Stuart at the newly completed New Park Theatre in April 1874 . It had been built by Stuart and Dion Boucicault , who pulled out just before the opening . Fechter acted in his own Loves Penance , an adaptation of Le médecin des enfants by le Comte dAvrigny . However the play flopped , and Fechter retired to a farm which he had bought at the little village of Rockland Township , Berks County , Pennsylvania , near Quakertown . The last three years of his life were spent in seclusion with his second wife , Lizzie Price , and his dogs on the farm , where he died . He was interred at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . A bust of the actor by himself is in the Garrick Club , London . Family life . He married , 29 November 1847 , Mlle Charlotte Eléonore Rabut ( 1819-1894 ) , a pensionnaire of the Comédie Française , Paris , by whom he had a son , Paul , and a daughter , Marie , who became an operatic singer . From 1850 to April 1855 , he had a love affair with the famous actress Pauline Virginie Déjazet ( 1798-1875 ) . References .

Louis . Earlier in her career ( up until the early 1990s ) she published under her former married name , Zuleyma Tang Halpin . Early life and education . Tang-Martínez was born in Venezuela on March 9 , 1945 . She and her family lived in ethnically segregated camps that were operated by an American oil company . Her father was a company accountant , permitting Tang-Martínez to be among the very few Venezuelans to be raised and attend school in the American camps . In 1960 , she was sent by her parents to attend a Catholic , all-girls , boarding high school in Tampa FL because the oil camp schools did not go beyond the 8th grade . She completed high school in 1963 ; the nuns at the high school convinced her to go to college as a pre-med student , despite the fact that her parents had planned only on her finishing high school - as she was the first in her family to complete a high school education . She received her bachelors degree cum laude from Saint Louis University , graduating in 1967 with a degree in biology . She moved to the University of California , Berkeley for her graduate studies , earning a masters degree in 1970 ( specializing in cancer research ) and a PhD in 1974 in Zoology ( specializing in animal behavior ) . Tang-Martínez was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia . For her dissertation she developed the habituation-discrimination technique in order to study individual discrimination by odors in the Mongolian gerbil Meriones unguiculatus . Career . Tang-Martínez was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Missouri–St . Louis in 1976 , the institution where she spent the rest of her career . She was very active in professional societies , especially with the American Society of Zoologists ( now the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology ) where she was elected as Chair of the Division of Animal Behavior . In the Animal Behavior Society , her primary scientific organization , she served as Chair of the Animal Care Committee , the Latin American Affairs Committee , and the Diversity Committee . In 1991 she was elected to the 4-year presidential sequence , serving as ABS President from 1993 to 1994 . . She studied social behavior , communication , and kin recognition of animals , as well as various aspects of dispersal , particularly with regards to how social structure impacts the genetics of populations . In 1987 she co-edited Mammalian Dispersal Patterns : The Effects of Social Structure on Population Genetics with Diane Chepko-Sade . More recently , she has challenged the theory of Angus John Bateman and Robert Trivers that male fruit flies behave more promiscuously due to their ability to produce millions of small sperm , and that this explains universal differences between male and female sexual behavior . . She has argued against the universal application of Batemans principle particularly with regards to the stereotypes of male and female sexual behaviour in humans . Her research was discussed in Angela Sainis . She described the relationship between sociobiology and feminism as complex and multidimensional . Tang-Martinez and her students studied a broad range of topics and species , including the social systems of rodents ( gerbils , voles , hamsters , black-tailed prairie dogs , eastern chipmunks , deer mice , and capybaras ) , as well as other mammals ( e.g. , raccoons , otters ) . Examples of her research include using habituation-discrimination to study the ability of voles and other mammals to detect individually-distinct odors . Tang-Martinez became Associate Professor in 1982 and full Professor in 1994 . She was Director of Womens Studies between 1989 and 1990 , and interim chair of her Biology department in 1990 . She has been concerned about students as higher education becomes more corporate . In 1993 she became President of the Animal Behavior Society . During her term in the presidential sequence of ABS ( a 4-year commitment ) , she created the ethnic diversity fund , which supports scientists from underrepresented groups to attend academic conferences . She also founded the Latin American Affairs Committee and served as its first Chair . Currently ( 2020 ) she is the Animal Behavior Society historian and serves as an ex-officio member on the Executive Committee of the society . In her duties as Historian , she organized the first ever symposium on the history of animal behavior , which was subsequently published as a special issue in the society journal , Animal Behaviour ( vol . 164 ) . . She retired in September 2011 and was made Founders Professor of Biology . In 2014 she edited ( jointly with Ken Yasukawa ) the first volume of the series Animal Behavior : How and Why Animals Do The Things They Do . She remains part of a National Science Foundation proposal to develop the next generation of animal behavioural scientists ( as Co-PI of Weaving the Future of Animal Behavior ) .

It competed in the UCI World Tour . The team was owned by Russian Oleg Tinkov and , from 1999 until March 2015 , was managed by former Tour de France winner Bjarne Riis . The team was sponsored by the Russian Tinkoff Bank , a credit systems company . Founded in 1998 as home-Jack &amp; Jones , the team started in cyclings second division . In 2000 it moved into the top division , now known as the UCI World Tour . Since 2000 , under differing sponsor names ( Memory Card-Jack &amp; Jones and CSC-Tiscali ) , the team rode the Tour de France . It has won the overall classification in all three of the Grand Tours . In the 2008 Tour de France , Carlos Sastre won the general classification , Andy Schleck won the young rider classification , and the team won the overall team classification , and Ivan Basso won the 2006 Giro dItalia , as well as finishing third and second in the 2004 and 2005 Tour de France . In addition , the team has won many major classics , including 6 Monuments . The team won the UCI ProTours team classification each year from 2005 through 2007 , and the team classification in the 2010 UCI World Ranking . In March 2015 the team confirmed that Riis had been removed from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov . Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned , and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team . His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March . Philosophy . When Bjarne Riis took over in winter 2000 , he hired the former Danish Ranger Corps soldier B.S . Christiansen as advisor and they gave CSC a distinct philosophy and training methods . The team works with four values : communication , loyalty , commitment and respect , with the aim of improving teamwork . The team rides for the rider in the best shape on the day , and separates the function of team captain ( the rider making decisions ) and team leader ( the rider trying to win ) to avoid pressure on a single rider . The team staff go on yearly outdoor education trips , physical challenges under pressure . According to B.S . Christiansen , the camps teach people that they can achieve their goals by cooperating . They have to perform their very best under the worst possible circumstances , where every action has a consequence . Bobby Julich , one of the riders , said that those days in the bush bonded us much closer and given [ sic ] us the strategies to work as a team in any racing situation . History . The company behind the team , initially named Professional Cycling Denmark , was created in autumn 1996 by former amateur cycling world champion Alex Pedersen , Finn Poulsen ( representing Bestseller ) , Torben Kølbæk and Johannes Poulsen ( from Herning CK ) , and Bjarne Riis ( then a Team Telekom rider ) . The team was built on the team license of Danish amateur team Herning CK , with headquarters in Herning , Denmark , with the goal of being picked for the 2000 Tour de France . home-Jack &amp; Jones : 1998–1999 . The team was assembled for 1998 with Alex Pedersen and Torben Kølbæk as sports directors . The team started with 11 riders , a mix of first-time professionals with Danish veterans Brian Holm and Jesper Skibby who had competed in the Tour de France several times , Skibby having won stage 5 in 1993 . The main sponsors were a Danish real estate agency ( home a/s ) , and a clothes manufacturer ( Jack &amp; Jones , a brand owned by Bestseller ) and the budget was around €1,000,000 for 1998 , including secondary sponsors . The team rode its first season in 2nd Division races , and during the first month both Christian Andersen and Jesper Skibby had minor wins . Holm quit the team in April 1998 . The doping scandal in the 1998 Tour de France didnt affect the team directly , but Riis , who was part of the peloton in the Tour de France , was branded a doping cheat in the Danish media in early 1999 . He sold his stock in Professional Cycling Denmark . The team finished 32nd best of 1998 , and with an increased budget of €2,400,000 combined , the number of riders was increased to 14 , with riders of a higher standard . In terms of races won , 1999 was the most successful season until 2005 : with 26 UCI victories the team was promoted to the 1st Division . In September 1999 Belgian rider Marc Streel was tested with a hematocrit level of 53.4 , a value above 50 being an indicator of EPO doping , and he was fired Home stopped sponsoring the team from the end of the season , citing doping . Memory Card-Jack &amp; Jones : 2000 . For 2000 , Memory Card A/S , a Danish producer of memory cards , stepped in as co-sponsor and Danish cyclist Bo Hamburger was brought in as captain . The 2000 season did not have as many wins as in 1999 but the calibre was higher and the team took part in the 2000 Tour de France . In April 2000 Nicolai Bo Larsen was tested with a 51 hematocrit level , but wasnt fired , as he had been tested with a 47 level the day before . The morning after his result of 51 , he again tested 47% . However , the apparent double standards harmed its image in Denmark and Jack &amp; Jones did not prolong sponsorship , despite Bo Larsens later being acquitted of doping by a medical report . In fall 2000 , Riis took over Professional Cycling Denmark and the team . After 2000 the contract with Jack &amp; Jones expired , and Riis did not continue working with Memory Card due to their financial difficulties . CSC-Tiscali : 2001–2002 . CSC ( Computer Sciences Corporation ) and the European Internet provider World Online took over as sponsors in a combined sponsorship of €4,500,000 . World Online was bought by the Italian telecom giant Tiscali and the team changed on 1 July 2001 to CSC-Tiscali . In April 2001 , Bo Hamburger tested positive with a newly developed method which distinguished natural EPO from synthetic EPO used in doping by determining the percentage of basic EPO . The first test showed 82.3 which was above the maximum of 80 imposed by the UCI , but as his secondary tests showed both 82.4 and 78.6 he was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) in 2002 . Bo Hamburger was released from his contract with CSC-Tiscali in September 2001 . The team gained international prominence after signing Laurent Jalabert before 2001 , following his many years with the Spanish ONCE team of Manolo Saiz . Jalabert said that , I wanted to retire with a French team , but nobody gave me a good offer , so I went with CSC instead . At the time , CSC was sponsored by the French bike manufacturer Look , which is associated with Jalabert . The team also signed American Tyler Hamilton , formerly of U.S . Postal . The 2001 season was a breakthrough with Jalaberts win of the King of the Mountains competition and a stage on Bastille Day at the Tour de France . The season ended with Jalabert winning the 2001 Clásica de San Sebastián . In 2002 Hamilton came second in the Giro dItalia despite a broken scapula . The team also nearly won the team time trial at the 2002 Tour de France , thwarted by a flat tire . Jalabert again won the King of the Mountains and repeated his victory at the Clásica de San Sebastián . He retired at the end of the season . Team CSC : 2003–2008 . In 2003 , Riis changed Professional Cycling Denmark to Riis Cycling . Tiscali ceased sponsorship , and Riis Cycling was unable to find a new co-sponsor , hence the team changed CSC-Tiscali to Team CSC and continued 2003 on a reduced budget . The headquarters moved from Herning to the headquarters of one of the sponsors , the Danish insurance company Alm . Brand in Lyngby , a Copenhagen suburb . Hamilton stepped up to be the team leader in 2003 , with the goal of winning the Tour de France . He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and was in form when he broke his collarbone in a pile-up on stage 1 of the Tour . He lost a lot of time . He made it up by winning a stage and finishing fourth , while his teammates Carlos Sastre and Jakob Piil also won stages . In 2004 Hamilton switched to the Swiss team , Phonak , citing lack of support from Riis . The team brought on Ivan Basso from Fassa Bortolo to join Carlos Sastre in competing for Grand Tour wins . Basso had been a former winner of the maillot blanc in 2002 . In the 2004 Tour de France , Team CSC had a very successful Tour , with Basso winning a mountain stage and reaching the podium in Paris with his third place finish . Bjarn Riis and Team CSCs efforts in the 2004 Tour were made into the cycling movie Overcoming . Following an off-season marred by financial difficulties that resulted in wage cuts for a number of riders , the 2005 spring season was the strongest yet for CSC , with wins by Julich and Jens Voigt . Julichs victory in Paris–Nice made him the first rider to wear the leaders jersey in the new UCI ProTour . This was followed by three team stage wins in the Giro dItalia , one by David Zabriskie and two by Basso , though the overall victory escaped from Basso when he was beset by a stomach ailment . Midway through the 2005 Tour de France , CSC extended sponsorship until 2008 at a higher level , enabling Riis to renew the contract with Basso for an additional three years . Basso got second place in the tour and Zabriskie won in the prologue . Julich won the Eneco Tour and Carlos Sastre came second . Nicki Sørensen won a stage of the Vuelta a España . Team CSC won the 2005 ProTour , with Julich as the #8 ranked individual rider of the year , the highest placed rider in the team . Until 2009 , the team used Cervélo bikes and Shimano components . The arrangement with the small Canadian manufacturer worked well for CSC , as Cervélos strength is time-trials , at which CSC has specialists . 2006 season . In 2006 , with sponsorship for several years , the focus was to win all three Grand Tours , with Ivan Basso riding both Giro dItalia and the Tour de France , and Carlos Sastre the Vuelta a España . They had come second in the 2005 in the Tour and Vuelta , respectively . The team had several time trialists , including Zabriskie , who had won time trials at the Giro and the Tour , Julich , as well as Fabian Cancellara . Others included Jens Voigt and Stuart OGrady from Australia , the only sprinter name in the team . The first victory of the 2006 UCI ProTour season was in the prologue of Paris–Nice by Julich . The spring was plagued with injuries hitting a third of the team , most notably OGrady . Cancellara won the time trial at Tirreno–Adriatico and then Paris–Roubaix . Fränk Schleck won the Amstel Gold Race a week later . Team CSC surprised by announcing that Sastre would ride the Giro as helper for Basso , that he would ride all three Grand Tours . 2005s winner Paolo Savoldelli was strongest in the first stages , and Jan Ullrich took a surprise win in the time trial ahead of Basso , but Basso dominated with three wins on mountain finishes and in the team time trial . Basso won by &lt;nowiki&gt;918&lt;/nowiki&gt; . On 30 June 2006 , the Tour de France announced that Basso would not ride the 2006 Tour after apparent involvement in the Operación Puerto doping scandal . Sastre took over as captain and was the strongest in the favorite group on the last mountain stages , but a poor last time trial placed him fourth overall . The team scored two stage wins , the most impressive Fränk Schlecks win on Alpe dHuez . Voigt had already won a flat stage after a long break . The autumn was dominated by the Bassos involvement in Operación Puerto . His contract was cancelled by mutual consent , and the case against Basso was eventually dropped by the Federazione Ciclistica Italiana for lack of evidence , but without him authorizing a DNA test that could have cleared him conclusively . Basso adamantly denied being involved . ( On 7 May 2007 Basso admitted involvement in Operación Puerto ) . Team CSC have since started an ambitious anti-doping program together with the Danish anti-doping expert Rasmus Damsgaard . Meanwhile , on the road , Voigt dominated the Deutschland Tour , winning overall and three stages , including a mountain finish and a time trial .

New rider Juan José Haedo gave the team a good start by winning early minor races . The classics season was a success by having OGrady win Paris–Roubaix . Voigt managed to defend his victory in Tour of Germany . CSC won the UCI ProTour team competition for the third year in a row . Sastre had a team dedicated to him for the Vuelta , while the team for the Tour was support riders and riders who could make individual results . This left the Giro without a clear rider for the general classification . Instead a youthful team was chosen , with the hope that Andy Schleck might win the youth competition . He won the youth competition and came second overall . For the Tour , Cancellara followed up a strong showing in the Tour de Suisse with two stage wins and seven days in the yellow jersey . But doping returned when the race hit the mountains . Alexander Vinokourov tested positive and leader Michael Rasmussen was withdrawn by his team for internal code violations . Sastre finished fourth . For the Vuelta , Sastre again lost time in time trials , especially the first , but climbed to second place . Because of the teams link to drug use ( Riis admitted doping , and Basso was suspended until 2008 ) , MAN Trucks dropped co-sponsorship midway through 2007 . CSC-Saxo Bank : 2008 . CSC announced that they would not renew the contract in spring 2008 , meaning Riis Cycling A/S would need a new main sponsor from 2009 . Mid-June , Riis Cycling A/S announced that Saxo Bank had entered a three-year contract as name sponsor , with immediate effect , so the team entered the 2008 Tour de France as Team CSC Saxo Bank . Carlos Sastre , having taken a lead of about two minutes on the final climb of LAlpe DHuez , won the Tour , and the team took the team classification . Team Saxo Bank : 2009–2010 . It was announced 28 September 2008 that for 2009 , IT Factory would be co-sponsor . However , the company went into receivership some two months thereafter . The team also began riding Specialized bicycles for the 2009 season . Saxo Bank-SunGard : 2011 . Although Saxo Bank had previously announced that 2010 would be the last year they would sponsor the team along with SunGard as secondary sponsor . The 2011 name for the team was announced in August 2010 as Team Saxo Bank-SunGard , and the signing of 2 time Tour de France champion Alberto Contador on a two-year contract was also revealed . On 29 July 2010 , Andy Schleck and his brother Fränk announced their departure from the team effective from the start of the 2011 season . On 16 November 2011 it was announced that SunGard would no longer be a title sponsor after 2011 . Saxo-Tinkoff &amp; Tinkoff-Saxo : 2012 . 2012 . On 25 June 2012 it was announced that the Russian Tinkoff Bank would join the team as co-sponsors for the rest of the 2012 season and through to the end of 2013 . Saxo Bank also renewed their sponsorship through 2013 , with the teams name thus becoming Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank .

Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned , and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team . Later that month it was announced that Riis contract had been terminated with the agreement of both parties . Subsequently the team revealed its new management structure , with Riis former duties being carried out by new general manager Stefano Feltrin and Steven de Jongh , who was promoted to the role of head sport director . In a December 2015 interview , Tinkov announced that he would sell the team at the end of the 2016 season , citing on the one hand a business decision to redirect Tinkoff Banks marketing budget from sports sponsorship to TV advertising from 2017 , and on the other a lack of support from other teams from his proposed reforms to the sports business model . 2016 . In February 2016 Tinkov said that although he was happy to talk to any buyer , he expected that the most likely outcome for the team would be its disbanding at the end of the year . However in July 2016 he said that he was planning to return to the sport after a few seasons off , once Chris Froome retires from competition , with the aim of winning the Tour de France .

In April 2001 , Bo Hamburger tested positive with a newly developed method which distinguished natural EPO from synthetic EPO used in doping by determining the percentage of basic EPO . The first test showed 82.3 which was above the maximum of 80 imposed by the UCI , but as his secondary tests showed both 82.4 and 78.6 he was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) in 2002 . Bo Hamburger was released from his contract with CSC-Tiscali in September 2001 . The team gained international prominence after signing Laurent Jalabert before 2001 , following his many years with the Spanish ONCE team of Manolo Saiz . Jalabert said that , I wanted to retire with a French team , but nobody gave me a good offer , so I went with CSC instead . At the time , CSC was sponsored by the French bike manufacturer Look , which is associated with Jalabert . The team also signed American Tyler Hamilton , formerly of U.S . Postal . The 2001 season was a breakthrough with Jalaberts win of the King of the Mountains competition and a stage on Bastille Day at the Tour de France .

We were a little bit delayed but the supporters are the most important thing . 2 days later , while attending a press conference Potter appeared to have suffered a facial injury with a cut just below his left eye . I would love to be able to tell you that there’s a heroic , chivalrous story here , that I can make myself look really good , but unfortunately I just missed my footing walking home on some steps and then went crashing into a metal railing , joking that his modelling days were already long gone . On 18 May , with fans returning to The Amex , Brighton came from 2–0 down to defeat champions Manchester City 3–2 , with Dan Burn scoring the winner with his first ever goal for the club .

Potter describes his teams as tactically flexible , attacking , [ and ] possession-based . At Östersund , he deployed a flexible 3–5–2 formation centred on ball possession . Former Celtic and Barcelona player Henrik Larsson commented on Potters pattern of play , stating he played all different kinds of systems , starting off a match one way , and then halfway through they started playing a different system , and then they ended up with a third system . And all the players knew exactly what they were doing . At Swansea , Potter used ten different formations and his team completed the most passes per 90 minutes in the Championship . As a young coach , Potter studied the training methods of Roberto Martínez at Swansea and became inspired by his possession-based approach , along with the holistic training principles he observed during his travels to Spain .

After Chris Hughton was dismissed as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion manager at the end of the 2018–19 season , Potter was heavily linked with the managerial vacancy , with Albion making an official approach for his services which Swansea initially rejected . However , several days later , Potter informed Swansea of his desire to leave the club and bring several of his backroom staff with him to Brighton .

We were a little bit delayed but the supporters are the most important thing . 2 days later , while attending a press conference Potter appeared to have suffered a facial injury with a cut just below his left eye . I would love to be able to tell you that there’s a heroic , chivalrous story here , that I can make myself look really good , but unfortunately I just missed my footing walking home on some steps and then went crashing into a metal railing , joking that his modelling days were already long gone . On 18 May , with fans returning to The Amex , Brighton came from 2–0 down to defeat champions Manchester City 3–2 , with Dan Burn scoring the winner with his first ever goal for the club .

Potter describes his teams as tactically flexible , attacking , [ and ] possession-based . At Östersund , he deployed a flexible 3–5–2 formation centred on ball possession . Former Celtic and Barcelona player Henrik Larsson commented on Potters pattern of play , stating he played all different kinds of systems , starting off a match one way , and then halfway through they started playing a different system , and then they ended up with a third system . And all the players knew exactly what they were doing . At Swansea , Potter used ten different formations and his team completed the most passes per 90 minutes in the Championship . As a young coach , Potter studied the training methods of Roberto Martínez at Swansea and became inspired by his possession-based approach , along with the holistic training principles he observed during his travels to Spain . Potter also cites the philosophy of Pep Guardiola and Raymond Verheijens periodisation model among his influences . Honours . As a manager .

She was married to Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark , the youngest child of King George I of Greece and his consort , Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia , but . Early life . She was born as May Stewart in Zanesville , Ohio , to William Charles Stewart , a wealthy merchant , and his wife , Mary Holden , who had been married since 11 December 1874 . By 1880 , the Stewart family had moved to Cleveland , Ohio , where it appears that Mays mother died not long afterward , and her father remarried . May was educated at home until the age of seventeen , when she was sent to Miss Porters School for young ladies in Farmington , Connecticut . She was soon introduced to high society . First and second marriages . As Nonie May Stewart , on 1 October 1894 in Cleveland , she married George Ely Worthington , son of Ralph Worthington ( who was a son of George Worthington , a major Cleveland industrialist ) . The marriage license inaccurately states that she was born in 1876 , since Ohio law required that females be at least 18 years of age to marry . The couple lived as husband and wife for four years , having no children . It is unclear how or where , but the marriage ended on 23 March 1899 by divorce , annulment or abandonment . The 1900 U.S . census records that May Worthington was again living with her father and step-mother in Cleveland that year ( George Ely Worthington had been born on 7 May 1872 in Cleveland and would die on 22 August 1950 in Temple City , California , leaving a widow and three children , having long outlived Princess Anastasia ) . Since the original marriage was contracted under false pretences and while May was legally underage , annulment is plausible . On 3 August 1900 , May married for the second time in Cleveland : the groom was William Bateman Leeds , a wealthy businessman who was born on 10 September 1861 in Richmond , Indiana . This was also Leeds second marriage , the previous one having ended in 1896 , at which time he settled one million dollars on his ex-wife . Nonie May and Leeds had one son , William Bateman Leeds , Jr. , born on 19 September 1902 . Leeds died in 1908 in Paris , France , leaving a fortune estimated at 35 million dollars and a reputation as Americas Tin King , based on his financial success in plating and marketing that metal . Third marriage . The wealthy , 30-year-old widow , soon to be known in Europe as Nancy May Leeds , chose to remain in Europe , where she socialised among the aristocracy . Leeds was a noted client of Cartier , having her own hall in this famous jewelry shop . She started collecting valuable art and furniture . In a memoir , published shortly before his death , Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark ( 1888–1940 ) addressed the persistent rumours alleging that his first wife was much older than he and that he married her for profit : The truth , he wrote , was that he met Mrs . Leeds , who was ten years his senior , in Biarritz , France in 1914 where they fell in love , eventually resolving to marry for no other reason . Their engagement was announced to the public in 1914 on the island of Capri . The wedding was delayed due to reservations within the Royal Family about the princes proposed marriage to an American commoner who had been married twice already . After the First World War , when the dynasty went into exile and lived in much-reduced circumstances , family opposition to Prince Christophers wealthy bride-to-be subsided . The Orthodox wedding took place on 1 February 1920 in Vevey , Switzerland , six years after the engagement . Four days later , the bride joined the Greek Orthodox church and took , as was usual , a new Christian name : Anastasia . Thereafter , she was officially styled as HRH Princess Anastasia of Greece . However , the U.S . press continued to refer to her as the Tin Plate Heiress , the Dollar Princess or the Million Dollar Princess . When Anastasias 19-year-old son , William B . Leeds , Jr. , married her third husbands 18-year-old niece , Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia , in 1921 , Anastasia is said to have objected because of the couples youth . She denied rumors that her son would be given a title by the King and convert to the Orthodox faith prior to the marriage . The couple were married in Paris , lived on Long Island ( where they had one daughter ) , and divorced in New York in March 1930 . Shortly after her marriage to Prince Christopher , Anastasia was diagnosed with cancer . She died three years later in 1923 at Spencer House , London . According to her will , her remains were returned to the United States and she was buried with her parents in the family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx , New York City . In 1929 , Prince Christopher married Princess Françoise of Orléans and fathered a son , Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark , who was born in January 1939 . Prince Christopher died a year later .
